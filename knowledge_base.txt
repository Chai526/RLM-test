Report on Corporate Governance
Corporate governance is about promoting fairness, transparency, accountability, commitment to values, ethical 
business conduct and considering all stakeholders’ interest while conducting business.
This report details the corporate governance policies and practices of Bajaj Finserv Ltd. (the ‘Company’, 
‘Bajaj Finserv’ or ‘BFS’) for FY2025 and outlines compliance with requirements of the Companies Act, 2013, 
as amended, (the ‘Act’) and the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 
and amendments thereto (the ‘SEBI Listing Regulations’), as applicable to the Company. As will be seen, the 
Company’s corporate governance practices and disclosures go well beyond complying with the statutory and 
regulatory requirements stipulated in the applicable laws.
Philosophy
For us, corporate governance is a reflection of principles rooted in our values and policies and also embedded 
in our day-to-day business practices. The commitment of Bajaj group to the highest standards of corporate 
governance predates the provisions of the SEBI Listing Regulations and clause 49 of erstwhile Listing 
Agreement. Ethical dealings, transparency, fairness, disclosure and accountability are the main thrusts of the 
working of the Bajaj group. The Company maintains the same tradition and commitment. We believe that the 
imperative for good corporate governance lies not merely in drafting codes for corporate governance but in 
practising and implementing the same in spirit.
Bajaj Finserv is a conglomerate of different financial services businesses – lending, general and life insurance, 
digital distribution, digital healthcare platform, stock broking, asset management and investment operated 
through its subsidiaries and joint ventures. Through its representation on the Boards of the subsidiaries, Bajaj 
Finserv seeks adoption of key group principles of corporate governance across its subsidiaries.

Board of Directors
The Board of Directors (‘Board’) and its Committees play significant role in upholding and furthering the 
principles of good governance which translates into ethical business practices, transparency and accountability 
in creating long-term stakeholder value.
Keeping with the commitment to the principles of integrity and transparency in business operations and 
good corporate governance, the Company’s policy is to have an appropriate blend of independent and 
non‑independent directors to maintain the independence of the Board and to separate the Board functions of 
governance and management.
The responsibilities of the Board, inter alia, include formulation of overall strategy for the Company, reviewing 
major plan of actions, oversight over subsidiaries, laying down the Code of Conduct for all members of the 
Board and the senior management team, formulating policies, conducting performance review, monitoring 
due compliance with applicable laws, reviewing and approving the financial results, enhancing corporate 
governance practices and ensuring the best interest of the shareholders, the community, environment and its 
various stakeholders.
The Board has constituted several Board sub-Committees. The remit of these Committees is governed by 
the regulations, operational requirements and such other matters requiring special and expert attention. 
Further, extensive review of terms of reference was carried out to align them with updated Regulations.

Opinion of the Board
The Board hereby confirms that, in their opinion, the independent directors fulfil the conditions specified under 
the SEBI Listing Regulations and the Act and that they are independent of the management of the Company.
Non-executive directors’ compensation
The Company believes that non-executive directors’ (‘NEDs’) (including independent directors) 
compensation must reflect the time, effort, attendance and participation in Board and Committee meetings. 
The compensation is proportionate to the attendance and ensures directors’ remuneration is commensurate 
with their time, effort, attendance and participation.
The members of the Company vide special resolution dated 22 June 2022, have approved the payment of 
commission up to a sum not exceeding one percent of the net profit of the Company, calculated in accordance 
with the provisions of section 198 of the Act, to be paid and distributed among the directors of the Company 
or some or any of them (other than the Managing Director and Whole-time Director, if any) in such amounts, 
subject to such ceiling/s and in such manner and in such respects, as may be decided by the Board of Directors 
from time to time during the period of five years commencing from 1 April 2022.
For FY2025, the NEDs of the Company are being paid commission at the rate of H 300,000 per meeting of the 
Board and/or its Committees attended by them.
The commission is paid to the directors’ post adoption of financial statements by the members at the annual 
general meeting.
The directors are also entitled to sitting fee of H 100,000 per meeting for every meeting of the Board and/or 
Committee (except Corporate Social Responsibility Committee) attended by them.
The Company does not have a stock option programme for any of its directors. However, Rajeev Jain has been 
awarded one time grant of stock options of BFS in capacity of Managing Director of Bajaj Finance Ltd.

Information placed before the Board
The Board is presented with relevant information on various matters related to the working of the Company and 
its subsidiaries, especially those which require deliberation at the highest level. Presentations are also made to 
the Board by key members of senior management team on important matters from time to time. Directors have 
separate and independent access to the officers of the Company and its material subsidiaries. In addition to 
items required to be placed before the Board for its noting and/or approval, information is provided on various 
significant matters.
Since the Company operates through its subsidiaries in diverse businesses, special presentations are made on 
specific businesses and/or topics as part of governance oversight over subsidiaries.
In terms of quality and importance, the information supplied by Management to the Board is far ahead of 
the mandate under the Act and SEBI Listing Regulations. The independent directors of the Company met on 
21 March 2025 and expressed their satisfaction on the quality, quantity and timeliness of flow of information 
between the Company’s Management and the Board.
Pursuant to the various regulatory requirements and considering business needs, the Board is apprised 
on various strategic, business, compliance and regulatory matters. During FY2025, it inter-alia, covered 
the following:
•	 Business plans, forecast and strategic initiatives of the Group
•	 Succession planning, organisation structure and talent management framework
•	 Annual operating plans/ financial budget of select subsidiaries
•	 Status of compliance with Act, SEBI Regulations and shareholder related matters

and at its subsidiaries

The Company has in place a D&O policy which is renewed every year. It covers directors (including independent 
directors) of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Board is of the opinion that quantum and risk presently 
covered is adequate.
Orderly succession to Board and Senior Management
One of the key functions of the Board of directors is selecting, compensating, monitoring, and when necessary, 
replacing key managerial personnel and overseeing succession planning.
Pursuant to regulation 17(4) of the SEBI Listing Regulations, the framework of succession planning for 
appointment of Board/senior management is placed before the Board for its review from time to time.
During the year under review, the Board was updated, inter alia, on the following:
•	 Framework to address anticipated, as well as unscheduled changes in leadership;
•	 Several programmes through which high performing talents are identified;
•	 Launch of four programmes in collaboration with the Indian School of Business (ISB);
•	 Series of interventions and experiential environments to develop their leadership qualities and skills;

and various mitigants are covered in detail in Management and Discussion Analysis and in the Directors’ Report.
74 18th Annual Report 2024-25
Risk Management
As BFS is an unregistered CIC, there are no significant risks that arise other than those arising 
from its material subsidiaries. 
Approach
The primary approach of BFS’s risk management is ‘bottoms up’, which is monitoring the risks 
of material subsidiaries which individually or in aggregate could culminate into a key capital or 
reputational risk for the Company.
Framework
BFS engages with its subsidiaries to understand the nature of risks, the assessment of risks as 
regards its criticality (severity and likelihood), mitigating actions and controls, monitoring and 
reporting of the same on a periodical basis to its Risk Management Committee.
Identification
Each of the 
material 
subsidiaries 
have laid down 
processes for 
identification 
of risks /risk 
events, which 
include self-
assessment by 
the risk owners, 
analysis of data, 
internal audit 
observations, etc.
Assessment
BFS identifies and 
assesses risks of 
its subsidiaries, 
which could 
materially impact 
its capital and 
reputation, which 
would become key 
risks for BFS.
Mitigation
Risk mitigation 
options are 
usually considered 
in determining 
the suitable 
risk treatment 
strategy by 
the subsidiaries.
BFS periodically 
discusses the 
results / status 
of mitigation 
activities on 
key risks with 
its subsidiaries.
Monitoring
Risks which 
have not been 
mitigated to an 
acceptable level 
are monitored 
against the key 
risk indicators, 
which are 
periodically 
reviewed for 
appropriateness 
by the 
subsidiaries.
BFS reviews 
the outcome of 
monitoring of 
key risks and the 
resulting action/ 
assessment by 
the subsidiaries.
Reporting
Reporting to 
the Committee 
inter‑alia, 
include the key 
risks, Business 
Continuity Plan, 
etc. for BFS and its 
material subsidiaries.
Risk Management approach and framework are outlined below:

accepts an Order by submitting a Licensee purchase order, order document, acknowledgment, or other Licensee 
communication, then regardless of whether HCLSoftware acknowledges, accepts, fully or partially performs 
under any such document, HCLSoftware objects to and rejects any additional or different terms in such document 
and no such additional or different terms will become part of the agreement between the Parties even if 
HCLSoftware uses or refers to such document for invoicing purposes.

(including timely payments of any Fees therein), HCLSoftware grants to Licensee a non-exclusive, non-

Program(s). 
3.2 Licensee Affiliates and Authorized Users may install, access, and use the Programs and Support under the 
terms of this Agreement, and such use shall be counted in determining Licensee’s utilization of the Licensed 
Capacity. Licensee shall remain fully responsible for ensuring its Affiliates’ and Authorized Users’ 
agreement and compliance with the terms of this Agreement and the Order.

required by HCLSoftware, Licensee shall provide HCLSoftware with specific information concerning 
Licensee’s experiences with the operation of the Pre-Release Program.  Licensee agrees and acknowledges 
that the Pre-release Program (a) is to be used only for testing purposes and not to perform any production 
activities unless HCLSoftware shall have otherwise approved in writing and (b) has not been tested or 
debugged and is experimental and that the documentation may be in draft form and will, in many cases, be 
incomplete.  Licensee agrees that HCLSoftware makes no representations regarding the completeness, 
accuracy or Licensee’s use or operation of the Pre-Release Program.  PRE-RELEASE PROGRAMS ARE 
PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT ANY INDEMNITY, WARRANTY OR 
REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING WITHOUT 
LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, 
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR PURPOSE AS WELL AS ANY EXPRESS WARRANTIES 
PROVIDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS AGREEMENT. If Licensee is also a tester of the Pre-release Program 
(as defined by the pre-release testing agreement (“Pre-Release Agreement”) that was agreed to by Licensee 
during the registration process before obtaining the Pre-release Program), Licensee agrees that the terms of 
this Agreement are in addition to, and do not supersede, the terms of the Pre-Release Agreement. 
3.4  If the Program is being licensed on a trial, demonstration or evaluation basis, Licensee agrees to use the 
Program solely for such purposes, in accordance with the usage restrictions set forth in Section 4, for the

Page 4 of 13 
 
evaluation period defined in the applicable Order or trial document (the "Trial Period").  At the end of the 
Trial Period, Licensee’s right to use the Program automatically expires and Licensee agrees to de-install the 
Program and return to HCLSoftware all copies or partial copies of the Program or certify to HCLSoftware in 
writing that all copies or partial copies of the Program have been deleted from Licensee’s computer libraries 
and/or storage devices and destroyed.  If Licensee desires to continue its use of the Program beyond the Trial 
Period, Licensee may contact HCLSoftware or an HCLSoftware Affiliate to acquire a license to the Program 
for the applicable fee.  LICENSEE’S USE OF THE PROGRAM DURING THE TRIAL PERIOD IS ON 
AN "AS IS" BASIS WITHOUT ANY INDEMNITY, WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION OF ANY 
KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY 
WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY 
OR FITNESS FOR PURPOSE, AS WELL AS ANY EXPRESS WARRANTIES PROVIDED 
ELSEWHERE IN THIS AGREEMENT.  
3.5 Licensee hereby acknowledges that the Program(s) may contain Third Party Software and/or Open Source 
Software and/or may require Program Requirements.  In the event that Open Source or Third Party Software 
is included in the Program(s), such Open Source or Third Party Software is made available to Licensee in 
accordance with the licenses for such Open Source or Third Party Software. In the event that the Program 
relies on Program Requirements and unless expressly provided otherwise in an Order, Licensee agrees that: 
(a) HCLSoftware and its Affiliates have not obtained or conveyed to Licensee any Intellectual Property 
Rights to use the applicable Program Requirements; (b) Licensee shall be solely responsible, at its cost and 
expense, for procuring the required rights/licenses in the Program Requirements; (c) HCLSoftware does not

10. Payments.   
10.1. Fees.  Licensee will pay any and all Fees, without deduction, offset or withholding, as detailed in the Order. 
Except as provided therein, all amounts in the Order are in United States Dollars (USD). HCLSoftware will 
invoice Licensee annually in advance.  Licensee will pay HCLSoftware for the amounts due, owing, and duly 
invoiced under the Order within thirty (30) days of the date of invoice. Licensee shall make all payments 
pursuant to the Order through electronic transfer of funds to the designated bank accounts as nominated by 
HCLSoftware in writing. Overdue amounts payable under the Order will bear interest from the original due 
date at the rate of one percent (1%) per month or the maximum legal rate, whichever is less. Except as 
provided in this Agreement, all Fees are non-refundable and non-cancellable. If the Licensee has a bona fide 
dispute in respect of the whole or any part of any invoice, Licensee shall notify HCLSoftware in writing 
within ten (10) days of receipt of an invoice and, if a dispute remains unresolved within 10 days of receipt of 
notification, Licensee may withhold payment of the amount in dispute but shall pay the undisputed amount 
in accordance with this Agreement. If HCLSoftware subsequently determines any disputed amount is due 
from Licensee, or if the Parties resolve the payment dispute, the amount due shall be paid within 7 days after 
such determination or resolution. 
10.2. Right to charge additional Fee. Where applicable, HCLSoftware reserves the right to charge, upon notice to 
the Licensee, additional fees if applicable for (i) over deployment as per Section 11; and (ii) re-instatement 
fee for lapsed Support and/or other Program. 
10.3. Taxes.  All Fees quoted are exclusive of taxes. Licensee is responsible for payment of any and all sales, use, 
value added, GST, and other similar taxes or governmental fees associated with the Order, except for taxes 
based on HCLSoftware’s net income, gross revenue or employment obligations. If HCLSoftware is obligated 
by applicable law to collect and remit any taxes or fees, the appropriate tax or fee amount will be charged 
and set forth in the applicable invoice. Licensee agrees to bear any withholding tax liability as may be required 
by applicable law and would increase payment due under the Order by such an amount so that the net payment 
made to HCLSoftware after deduction of applicable withholding tax is the same, had there been no 
withholding tax applicable. Licensee is solely responsible for timely and accurate payment of applicable taxes 
and fees without deduction from HCLSoftware’s invoiced amounts, irrespective of what HCLSoftware’s 
invoice may state. Subject to applicable laws and presentation of a valid tax exemption certificate provided 
within the period of the payment terms, HCLSoftware will make relevant adjustments in the invoice.  
Licensee shall remain liable for any incorrect claims of tax exemptions. 
11. License Compliance.  Licensee agrees that HCLSoftware may, no more than one time per twelve (12) month 
period, audit the Licensee’s use of the Programs including but not limited to software logs of Licensee, its 
Affiliates and Authorized Users, relating to the Program in order to verify their use in compliance with this 
Agreement and/or the Order.  HCLSoftware may make copies of any such software logs to the extent necessary 
to verify Licensee’s compliance with the terms hereof.  HCLSoftware may at its option and cost, engage an 
independent third party to do such audit, provided that such third party is subject to confidentiality obligations 
consistent with this Agreement.  The audit may be conducted at any sites of Licensee’s Affiliates and Authorized 
Users, where the Program is installed, used or accessed from, including remotely.  HCLSoftware will bear its 
own costs in connection with an audit. HCLSoftware will provide fifteen (15) calendar days’ notice prior to an 
audit.  Any such audit will be performed during the usual business hours of the Licensee, its Affiliates or 
Authorized Users and HCLSoftware will use commercially reasonable efforts to have the audit conducted in a 
manner that minimizes disruption to business.  Licensee, its Affiliates, and Authorized Users will provide all 
assistance reasonably necessary for HCLSoftware to carry out such audit.  If the audit reveals underpayments, 
including but not limited to any underpayments due to any usage of Programs other than as authorized in this 
Agreement, Licensee will promptly make such payments and in case of unauthorized usage, pay for the

differentials at HCLSoftware’s then list price for the Program.  As with all provisions of this Agreement, 
HCLSoftware’s rights and remedies in this section will be without prejudice to other rights and remedies

13. Confidentiality.  Except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement, both Parties will hold in confidence 
the Programs, Documentation and all other non-public or proprietary information or any other information that 
by its form, nature, content or mode of transmission would to a reasonable recipient be deemed confidential or 
proprietary as made available by the disclosing Party (“Confidential Information”).  Both Parties agree that the 
Programs and Documentation will be treated as proprietary trade secrets of HCLSoftware. Neither Party will 
make Confidential Information available in any form to any person or entity other than to its respective Affiliates 
and Licensee’s Authorized Users on a need to know basis and subject to the same restrictions of this Section 13. 
Recipients of Confidential Information that are not employees of either Party must be subject to confidentiality 
restrictions no less stringent than those contained herein (in the case of non-employees such restrictions will be 
contained in a written agreement executed by the applicable contractor/person/entity).  Each Party warrants to 
the other Party that it maintains a system of confidentiality to protect its own Confidential Information, including 
written agreements with employees, that the Confidential Information will be protected by such system using no 
less than a reasonable degree of care, and that it shall ensure its recipients’ compliance with this Section. If the 
receiving Party at any time becomes aware of any unauthorized use or disclosure of the disclosing Party’s 
Confidential Information, it will promptly and fully notify the disclosing Party of all facts known to it concerning 
such unauthorized use or disclosure and reasonably cooperate with the disclosing Party in seeking a protective 
order or other appropriate remedy to limit such disclosure.

or omission of Licensee or its representatives, or any other non-HCLSoftware person or entity, including but 
not limited to: (a) the misuse of or damage to the Program; (b) modifications to the Programs not made by or 
as authorized in writing in advance by HCLSoftware; (c) combination or use of the Programs with other 
software, hardware or cloud infrastructure not provided by HCLSoftware; (d) use of the Program in an 
operating environment other than that described in the Documentation or Program Requirements mutually 
agreed in writing; or (e) failure to install updates, patches or fixes provided by HCLSoftware.

CONDITION OF ANY KIND. 
14.5. Performance Warranty Remedy. In the event of breach of the above stated Performance Warranty, 
Licensee’s remedy is for HCLSoftware, in consultation with Licensee, to either (i) use reasonable efforts 
consistent with industry standards to repair the defect within a commercially reasonable time frame, (ii) 
replace the affected Program(s) with one that materially complies with the Documentation, or in the event (i) 
or (ii) do not resolve the issue to then (iii) terminate the license and provide a pro-rata refund of the license

number of months left remaining on the Term of the applicable Order or if the Program(s) is licensed under 
a perpetual license, using (only for purposes of a refund calculation) an amortization schedule of three (3) 
years. The above warranty remedies are HCLSoftware’s sole obligation and Licensee’s sole and exclusive

allegation, or suit, HCLSoftware, in its sole discretion, may reengineer the Program(s) in a manner that removes 
the infringing material, replace the Program(s) with non-infringing software, or terminate the Agreement or 
applicable Order.   HCLSoftware will not be liable for any costs or damages and will not indemnify or defend 
Licensee to the extent such action is based upon a claim arising from:  
 
15.1.1. modification of the Program(s) by a party other than HCLSoftware after delivery by HCLSoftware;

infringement; or

infringement claims and are conditioned on the following: (i) HCLSoftware is notified promptly in writing of

provisions of this Agreement will be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and 
enforceability of the remaining provisions will not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTS 
The Bank will mail a Statement of transactions in the Card Account every month on a predetermined date, to the mailing 
address provided by the Cardmember.  
Non-receipt of the Statement for any reasons whatsoever is not a valid reason for non-payment of dues. Should the 
Cardmember not receive the Statement within 7 days from the usual Statement date, the Cardmember is requested to 
call the HDFC Bank Credit Cards Division to check the amount payable. Requests for duplicate Statements will attract 
charges as determined by the Bank from time to time. The Statement date is predetermined and cannot be changed. The 
Cardmember further agrees that the Bank may round off the bill as determined appropriate by the Bank from time to time. 
The amount paid in excess of the actual bill amount will be adjusted in the next billing cycle. 
The Cardmember should promptly notify the Bank of any unauthorised transactions appearing on the Statement to enable 
investigation/amendments (if necessary). These transactions should be notified/referred within 30 days from the date of 
the Statement, after the expiry of which the Bank will not be liable for any refunds that may be related to such transactions. 
The Statement will have detail all transactions received and processed in the Card Account including any refunds or 
payments made since the date of previous Statement and up to the close of business on the day of the current Statement 
date. 
The amount outstanding on the Cardmember's Statement will be made up of the following: 
The amounts charged for all goods and services purchased by the use of card including all mail and telephone order, or 
over the Internet and authorised by the Cardmember or by any (Add-on) Cardmember to be charged to the Card Account. 
Cash advances on the Cardmember's Card Account including those incurred through Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) 
wherever applicable. 
All Balance Transfers, if any, availed of by the Cardmember. 
The charges set out elsewhere in the Cardmember Agreement (e.g., Fees, Service Charges, Service Tax etc.) 
The Cardmember should check each Statement of Account carefully on receipt and immediately notify the Bank of any 
unauthorised mail or telephone order/internet, any disputed transaction or any other error. 
International transactions on the HDFC Bank International Credit Card: These will be identifiable by a second memo line 
appearing under the Merchant name - detailing the Foreign Currency and amount. 
TRANSACTIONS 
Whenever the Cardmember signs a sales slip/charge slip, mail order form, places a telephonic/internet order, or any other 
document authorising the Bank to accept a transaction on the Card Account, the Cardmember(s) is/are agreeing to, 
confirming the validity and acknowledging the amount (including and/or any fee or service charge) shown on that 
document relevant to the price of the goods and/or services obtained. It must be noted that service charges or any fees 
levied are not refundable in case of a dispute. 
Similarly, when the Cardmember signs a cash advance voucher, the Cardmember is agreeing to and confirming the validity 
and accuracy of the amounts shown (including and/or any fee or service charge) shown on that voucher relevant to the 
cash obtained. In some cases, the Cardmember may be requested to acknowledge the receipt of cash on the same or 
separate voucher. 
The Cardmember must ensure to keep copies of all such vouchers/documents in a safe manner at least till such time as 
the transaction is reflected in the Statement. 
The Cardmember must not at any point, hand over the card to any other person for use. It must also be ensured that the 
Cardmember is physically present at the Merchant Establishment (except in the case of mail/telephone order/internet 
transaction) at the time of the transaction. 
The Cardmember must ensure that the card/PIN is not shared with any other person for usage. In the event of any such 
usage it will be deemed as criminal/civil offence as the case may be. The Bank reserves the right to proceed legally against 
the Cardmember and the person suspected of such usage as per applicable laws. The Cardmember should not use 
retail/consumer card for the purpose of funding the working capital and/or other financial requirements of any business 
owned by him/her. 
Prior to completion of a transaction on his/her Card Account, if the Cardmember wishes to cancel the same, he/she must 
advise the Merchant and ensure the destruction of the voucher/document in his/her presence. 
8 
 
 
Where the card transaction is being processed on any electronic terminal the transaction would typically have been 
completed by the time the voucher is presented for the Cardmember's signature. 
In such cases, the Cardmember must ensure that the Merchant completes a 'refund' transaction or 'voids' the transaction 
and provides the Cardmember with evidence (e.g., Credit Voucher) of the same. 
The Cardmember must retain this evidence and advise the Bank if the refund does not appear on the next Statement of 
Account or if the transaction that has been voided appears in the Statement of Account. 
Similarly, where a transaction is previously completed and the Merchant is subsequently willing to accept a cancellation 
(e.g., Airline or Railway Bookings etc.), the Cardmember must ensure that the Merchant completes the refund in the form 
of a Credit Voucher (with the imprint of the card). The Cardmember must retain a copy of this voucher and he/she must 
advise the Bank of this refund if it does not appear on the account within thirty days from the date of cancellation. 
A purchase and a subsequent credit for cancellation of goods/services like air/rail tickets are two separate transactions. 
The Cardmember must pay for the purchase transaction as it appears on the Statement, to avoid charging of any fee. The 
refund will only be credited to the Card Account (less cancellation charges) as and when received from the Merchant. 
FEES AND SERVICE CHARGES 
The Bank reserves the right to charge the Credit Card Account with fees and charges. The Bank is also irrevocably 
authorised to debit the Credit Card Account with joining fee (as applicable) in the first year and with an annual membership 
fee (as applicable) each year until the Credit Card Account is closed. The Annual Membership Fee is payable in advance 
and no refund is payable when the Credit Card Account is closed. The Primary Card and Add-on Cards will attract Annual 
fees as specified from time to time. The monthly Statement of Account will detail all such fees and charges applied to the 
Credit Card Account. 
The Joining and Annual fee(s) are subject to changes at the discretion of the Bank and are not refundable. The Cardmember 
agrees for these fees to be charged to the monthly Statement that will be generated by the Bank. 
INTEREST 
Unless the interest-free period applies as set out below, HDFC Bank will levy an interest on any new purchase (and any 
related debited charge) from the day on which the purchase (and any related debited charge) is transacted on the Card 
Account. The interest free period for a purchase (and any related debited charge) in any Statement period will apply if the 
outstanding balance on the Card Account for the previous Statement period (if any) is paid in full by its due date. If the 
outstanding balance on the Card Account is not paid in full by its due date, finance charge will be levied on both 
statemented outstanding and new purchases (and any related debited charge), from the date of each transaction on the 
card account till the date of complete payment is made. 
HDFC Bank will charge interest on a Cash Advance from the day on which the Cash Advance is transacted on the Card 
Account till the date of repayment of the Cash Advance (including cash interest accrued thereof) in full. 
HDFC Bank will ordinarily levy interest on the purchase balance outstanding on the Card Account on a daily basis by 
applying its current daily percentage rate to the amount of the purchase balance outstanding at the end of each day. HDFC 
Bank will levy a finance charge on Cash Advance balances on a daily basis by applying its current daily percentage rate to 
the amount of the Cash Advance balance at the end of each day. 
The interest as above, will continue to be payable after termination of this agreement or closure of the Card Account until 
the card balance is cleared in full. 
HDFC Bank may at any time, under intimation to the Cardmember, vary the interest to take into account prevailing interest 
rates, market forces and credit and business risks. The Bank may offer differential rates on preferential Cardmember 
behaviour. This is entirely at the discretion of the Bank and could mean revision of interest rates  higher or lower than the 
rate prevailing at that point of time. 
GOVERNMENT FEES AND CHARGES 
Various government duties, rates, taxes or charges will apply to and be payable by the Cardmember for the operation of 
the Credit Card Account. The Cardmember agrees to reimburse the Bank for payment of any such taxes, rates or charges 
or other similar taxes or levies payable in connection with any advances, finances or credit provided by the Bank to the 
Cardmember. 
Goods & Services Tax (GST) 
· The applicable GST would be dependent on place of provision (POP) and place of supply (POS),If POP and POS is in the 
same state then applicable GST would be CGST  and SGST/UTGST  else, IGST. 
 ·  GST For FEE & Charges / Interest transactions Billed on statement date will reflect in next month statement. 
 ·  GST levied will not be reversed on Any dispute on Fee &Charges / interest. 
PAYMENTS 
As per the RBI guidelines, in case the amount on account of use of the Card overseas is greater than the  
Cardmember's Foreign Exchange entitlements, the Cardmember should provide the reimbursement claimed, and the Bank 
is authorised to report the matter to the Regional Office of the Exchange Control Department giving full details. 
However, under no circumstances should the payment of the Credit Card bill/dues be delayed or refused on the grounds 
of the Cardmember having exceeded the entitlement. There will be no obligation on HDFC Bank to make a claim or demand 
for payment on a Cardmember and non-payment shall render the Cardmember liable to risk of withdrawal (whether 
temporarily or permanently) of his card membership. MONTHLY REPAYMENTS TO CARDMEMBER'S CARD ACCOUNT  
Amounts which are payable immediately 
Overlimit Amount - If at any time, the outstanding balance on the Statement of Account exceeds the approved Credit 
Limits, this Overlimit Amount must be paid immediately. 
9 
 
 
Overdue Amount - If 'Minimum Amount Due' remains unpaid from previous Statements of Account; these oOverdue 
amounts must be paid immediately. 
Amounts which are payable by the 'Due Date' 
Each month the Cardmember may pay as much as he/she wishes towards the 'Closing Balance' shown on the Statement 
of Account, provided the payment is not less than the amount shown on the Statement of Account as the 'Minimum 
Amount Due'. 
If the Cardmember does not wish to pay the full amount of the closing balance shown on the monthly Statement of 
Account he/she can avail of the Revolving Credit Facility and will need to pay only the Minimum Amount Due as shown on 
Statement of Account. All payments must be made prior to the due date, irrespective of whether or not Statement has 
been received by the Cardmember. Non-receipt of a Statement will not be considered a valid reason for non-payment. In 
the event that the Cardmember has not received the Statement, he/she can calculate the amount based on the unpaid 
chargeslips in his/her possession. 
(WEF June’25), MAD = Total GST + EMI amount + 100% of Fees/Charges + 5% of [Finance Charge (if any) + Retail Spends 
and Cash Advance (if any)] +Overlimit Amount (if any). In case 5% of (Finance Charge + Retail Spends and Cash Advance) 
is less than Finance Charges, then MAD will be Total GST + EMI amount + 100% of Fees/Charges + 100% of Finance Charges 
+ 5% of [Retail Spends + Cash Advance (if any)] + Overlimit Amount (if any) of the Statement Closing Balance or Rs. 200, 
(or such other amount as notified from time to time), whichever is greater. (This does not apply to cancelled or closed 
Cards in case of which full outstanding amount needs to be cleared immediately on demand). If the closing balance is less 
than Rs. 200 (or such other amount as notified from time to time) it must be paid in full. 
The due date for payment (which presently would be approximately 20 days from the Statement date) is the last date by 
which the payments should reach the Bank. It may be noted that the due date is only a convenience to enable Statements 
to reach the Cardmember and also to provide time to process the Cardmember's payments. Future transactions on the 
account may be declined if the payment is not received within the due date and all transactions will attract service charges 
from the date of purchase. 
The Cardmember's payments will first be applied to all overdue amounts (the oldest due being credited first) in the 
following order: 
1. Fees and other Charges 
2. Interest 
3. Balance Transfer Amount Billed (if applicable) 
4. Cash Advances Billed 
5. Retail Transactions Billed 
6. Balance Transfer Amount Current (if applicable) 
7. Cash Advances Current 
8. Retail Transactions Current 
Payment will be treated as made from the date on which the payments are credited to the Card Account in the ordinary 
course of business. Payments made by cheque drawn on a location where the Bank does not have a branch will be subject 
to a processing and handling fee as determined by the Bank from time to time, in addition to Drawee Bank's charges for 
all outstation cheques. Generally, payments made in cash or through Direct Banking Channels will be credited to the Card 
Account within 2 business days, provided, they are made prior to the close of business hours as applicable. Proceeds of 
payments to the account such as cheques cannot be used or withdrawn until funds are confirmed as cleared. If, for any 
reason (whether at Cardmember's request or otherwise) the Bank allows withdrawal or use of the proceeds of the cheque 
or other such payment before it has been cleared, the Bank will be entitled to debit the Card Account, in the event that 
the cheque or other such payment is later dishonoured and the Cardmember shall be completely liable to make payments 
thereof and on account thereof. 
Payment towards multiple Card Accounts (held by the same Cardmember or otherwise) cannot be made vide a single 
cheque. The Bank does not undertake the responsibility of apportionment of such payment as may be desired by the 
Cardmember. 
If the Cardmember is not going to be able to access his/her mail around the period that he/she usually receives the 
Statement, it would be the Cardmember's responsibility to make arrangements to ensure that at least the   Minimum 
Amount Due reaches the Bank before the Payment Due Date. 
The Bank has made arrangements to provide Drop Box facilities at various locations in serviceable cities as determined by 
the Bank from time to time. The updated list of Drop Box locations may be communicated to the Cardmember as 
appropriate. The Cardmember is advised to use these Drop Boxes to deposit only locally payable cheques or drafts along 
with Payment Vouchers/stubs (tear off portion of Statement) duly completed with the cheque details. 
Cardmembers are advised not to issue post-dated cheques towards card outstanding as the Bank does not in the normal 
course of operations offer to clear post-dated cheques. 
Timely payment towards the card dues is essential and it is a condition of this Agreement that all payments towards 
Minimum Amount Due must reach HDFC Bank on or before the Payment Due Date indicated in the monthly Statement of 
Account. 
If the Minimum Amount Due is not paid by the Payment Due Date, a late payment fee as specified in the tariff sheet will 
be debited to the Card Account and is subject to change at the discretion of HDFC Bank. 
Non-payment of card dues shall also render the Cardmember liable to risk of instant withdrawal of the card membership 
without prior notice. RETURNED PAYMENTS 
In case the cheque or any other payment instrument forwarded by the Cardmember is not honoured or must be returned 
to the Cardmember because it cannot be processed, HDFC Bank reserves the right to proceed legally against the 
10 
 
 
Cardmember and would at its discretion levy a penal fee and/or temporarily withdraw credit facilities on the card. 
Repeated instances of payment instruments not being honoured could result in cancellation of the account. A cheque 
return fee at the prevailing rate would be levied on the amount of the returned cheque subject to a minimum amount as 
specified by the Bank from time to time. 
The attention of the Cardmember is invited to the provisions of section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and 
to the serious criminal penalties therein specified for the dishonour of cheques. AUTO-DEBIT 
If the Cardmember has a Current Account or a Savings Account at any of our branches in India, the Bank may at its sole 
discretion arrange to have any one of these accounts debited automatically every month on the Cardmember's written 
request. 
The Cardmember may note that the Auto-Debit facility will not be available on certain classes of Accounts as determined 
by the Bank from time to time. Accounts currently residing in Micro Banker will not be eligible to participate in this facility. 
The Automatic debit will be processed on the registered account nominated by the Cardmember from the Payment Due 
Date and will be credited to the Card Account. In the event of non-realization of payment in the first attempt, repeat 
attempts will be made until realization of payment 
Cardmember must have sufficient cleared funds in the nominated Savings or Current Account at the time of the debit 
being processed. In case the Cardmember has instructed the Bank to clear the Card Account balance fully (i.e., 100% Auto-
Debit) each month, but the cleared balance available in the nominated Savings or Current Account is insufficient in any 
month, the Auto-Debit service will instead claim only the Minimum Amount Due (if the cleared balance in the nominated 
account is sufficient to cover the Minimum Amount Due). In such instances of nonrecovery for Total Amount Due for two 
successive months, the Auto-Debit instruction for all subsequent months will be amended by the Bank to claim for the 
Minimum Amount Due until receipt of fresh instructions from the customer. Where the Auto-Debit service claims the 
Minimum Amount Due, and the nominated Savings or Current Account does not have sufficient funds to meet the claim, 
the amount will be reserved to Cardmember's Card Account and the Auto-Debit reversal charges at the prevailing rate 
would be levied to the Card Account. In such instance of non-recovery of Minimum Amount Due for two successive 
months, the Auto-Debit instruction for all subsequent months will be cancelled until receipt of fresh instructions from the 
customer for incorporation of Auto Debit. The Bank reserves the right to accept and/or subsequently cancel or not accept 
any such instructions. 
In case the Cardmember has instructed the Bank to claim for amounts other than the Minimum Amount Due and there is 
a credit or a payment made to the Card Account before the Payment due date, the Bank may at its discretion claim only 
the residual amount i.e., the difference between the amount outstanding as per the Statement and the payments/other 
credits received before the Payment due date. The Bank reserves the right to amend its policies with respect to such 
instructions from time to time. 
In case the Cardmember has instructed the Bank to claim for amounts other than the Minimum Amount Due and in the 
event of non-recovery of funds, the Bank will attempt to recover at least the Minimum Amount Due on the Card Account. 
In future, the Bank may introduce at its discretion a variable option for Auto-Debit facility. Where the Cardmember has 
opted for a variable amount and the Minimum Amount Due payable on the Card Account is higher than the option 
exercised, the Bank reserves the right to claim the higher of the two. 
If the Auto-Debit cannot be claimed for insufficient funds on the recovery date, the Auto-Debit reversal charges would be 
levied irrespective of any other payment/credit made into the Card Account through any other mode other than Auto-
Debit. 
The Bank at a predetermined overdue status would reserve the right to withdraw the standing instructions given by the 
Cardmember without any prior notice and the facility may not be made available in future. 
In a specific case where subsequent to providing instruction to the Bank to Auto-Debit a nominated account, the 
nominated account is closed or transferred to another branch, the Cardmember undertakes to advise the Cards Services 
Division of the Bank of the change in status of the nominated account. Please note that the service or penal charges that 
accrue to the Cardmember's account because of non-compliance or delay of this advice will not be refunded. 
OPERATING ELECTRONIC TERMINALS 
The term 'Electronic Terminal' includes: 
Any HDFC Bank branch teller machines as and when introduced; 
Any of the Bank's Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) and Cash Dispensers; 
Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) and Cash Dispensers of other selected Banks/financial institutions; Electronic Funds 
Transfer at Point of Sale (EFTPOS) terminals; and, 
Any other authorised terminal or device connected to the Bank's electronic Banking system as and when introduced. 
The Bank will specifically advise the Cardmember whenever the card is acceptable for use at our ATMs (Automated  
Teller Machines) or other bank's ATMs or other specified electronic devices. In such cases, where applicable, the Bank will 
provide the Cardmember with a PIN (Personal Identification Number). The Bank reserves the right to alter the types of 
accounts, which may be operated or the types of transactions, which may be undertaken using the card and PIN, at any 
time. In the event that the service is being provided on the card, the Bank will endeavour to maintain electronic access on 
our ATMs or electronic devices/terminals unless: 
An Electronic Banking Terminal malfunctions or is otherwise unavailable for use.  
The Card Account is overdue or otherwise considered irregular by the Bank. 
In any of these events, electronic access to the nominated accounts may be withdrawn without prior notice to the 
Cardmember, without any liability devolving upon the Bank for such withdrawal. 
The Bank will advise the Cardmember of his/her PIN in a secure manner. On receipt of this PIN, the Cardmember must 
memorise it and destroy the original PIN advice. The Bank's ATMs may allow the Cardmember to change the PIN (originally 
11 
 
 
advised by the Bank) to a PIN of his/her choice. The PIN advised to the Cardmember by the Bank is confidential and must 
not be made known by the Cardmember to anybody. The Bank will not be liable or responsible for any consequences of 
the Cardmember's valid PIN becoming known to a third party. The Cardmember will be liable for all consequences in the 
event of any loss due to the misuse of his/her PIN. 
If, after memorising the PIN, the PIN is lost or stolen, or if the PIN becomes known to somebody else, and if the card is still 
in the Cardmember's possession, he/she should immediately advise the Cards Division of the Bank. Any delays may expose 
the Cardmember to the liability of unauthorised use of the card. 
Subject to the Card Account being valid, if the card is retained in the ATM, the Cardmember should contact our 24Hour 
Customer Call Centre for assistance. A replaced card will be forwarded for a fee as specified by the Bank from time to time. 
CHANGES TO TRANSACTIONS THROUGH TERMINALS 
Any transaction made by the Cardmember at any electronic terminal cannot be cancelled, altered or changed by  the 
Cardmember. PROCESSING DATE 
For transactions made at any of the Bank's ATMs and ATMs of other selected banks/financial institutions the Bank will 
endeavour to process the same to the Card Account on the same or following business day provided they are made prior 
to the close of the Bank's business hours. 
PRINTED TRANSACTION RECORDS 
When the Cardmember completes a transaction at an electronic terminal he/she will receive a printed transaction record. 
The Cardmember must check the record carefully. The Cardmember should retain these records for verification purposes 
and to aid in reconciling Account Statements. 
Some of our ATMs will offer the option of not receiving a transaction record. However, it is recommended that the 
Cardmember always choose to receive a transaction record. 
TRANSACTION LIMITS 
The Bank may change or impose limits on the amount of funds that are made available through electronic  terminals, over 
any specified period of time for transactions that require the use of a card and PIN. Merchants and other banks/financial 
institutions may also impose additional restrictions on transaction limits. ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER AT POINT OF 
SALE (EFTPOS) 
When using the card at an EFTPOS terminal, the Cardmember agrees that the Bank will not be held responsible or liable, 
unless required by law, for: 
Any Bank/Financial Institution or Merchant refusing to accept or honour the card; or Any goods 
or services purchased with a card 
Any complaint about goods or services must be resolved only with the Merchant concerned. If an EFTPOS terminal 
malfunctions or is otherwise unavailable for use, alternative manual transactions may be made using the card and a 
transaction voucher must be signed by the Cardmember at the request of the Merchant. 
POINT-OF-SALE (POS) TRANSACTION 
When using the card at a POS terminal, the Cardmember agrees that the Bank will not be held responsible or liable, in the 
event that a POS terminal malfunctions or is unavailable for use. Alternative manual transactions may be made using the

made strictly in accordance with the Exchange Control Regulations of the RBI and that in event of failure to do so the 
Cardmember may be liable for penal action under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999. With a view to protect 
the interest of Card members, HDFC Bank reserves the right to decline at its sole discretion, certain Internet transactions, 
depending on the origin and nature of purchase. This is done with a view to protect the Cardmembers from unauthorised 
or fraudulent usage of account information by persons/parties. 
DISPUTES 
Any chargeslip or other payment requisition received from a Merchant Partner by HDFC Bank for payment shall be 
conclusive proof that the charge recorded on such chargeslip or other requisition, was properly incurred for the amount 
and by the Cardmember referred to in that chargeslip or other requisition, as the case may be, by the use of the Credit 
Card, except where the Credit Card has been lost, stolen or fraudulently misused, the burden of proof for which shall be 
on the Cardmember and for which prior intimation to the Bank must be provided by the Cardmember. The other payment 
requisition referred to in this clause shall include any and all payments pertaining to permissible expenses incurred by a 
Cardmember at a Merchant Partner by use of the card which is not recorded on a chargeslip. 
If the Cardmember believes that an error has occurred in the Statement he/she should promptly inform the Bank in writing, 
(so that the same is received by the Bank within 30 days of the date of Statement in which the transaction under dispute 
was charged). The operating rules applicable under the Credit Card Scheme impose time limits on reporting disputed 
transactions. If the Cardmember does not report/inform the Bank within time, this makes it difficult for the Bank to gather 
information about the transactions and this may work to the Cardmember's disadvantage. 
It is therefore advisable to notify the Bank of any disputed transactions immediately upon receipt of the Statement of 
Account. This includes any disputes regarding Reward Points (if applicable) allocated to the Card Account. To assist the 
Bank with its investigations, the Cardmember will need to provide the following information: Cardmember name and card 
number 
Details of the transaction in question 
Wherever necessary the Bank will contact the Cardmember should it need any further information. Pending the Bank's 
investigation and correction (if any), the Bank may, at its sole discretion, credit the Cardmember's account with the 
disputed amount and debit the appropriate Reward Points (if applicable) till a conclusion is arrived in respect of the 
12 
 
 
dispute. Where, after completion of investigations, the Bank concludes that no error has occurred, the Bank may advise 
the Cardmember accordingly, and the account if already credited will be promptly debited for the disputed amount with 
relevant credit of Reward Points (if applicable) with the original transaction date, and interest will accrue accordingly. If, 
in the process of investigating the Cardmember's query, the Bank has had to retrieve voucher copies either from its 
archives or through another bank entity, the Cardmember's account will be debited for retrieval fees as specified by the 
Bank from time to time. Amounts due on the transactions including disputed transactions are payable by the due date 
appearing on the Statement of Accounts. 
In case of any dispute on an Add-on Cardmember usage, a copy of the chargeslip in a card present environment will be 
deemed to be conclusive proof of usage by the Add-on Cardmember and will be binding on the Primary Cardmember to 
construe the same as valid/due and payable. During the course of any interaction on the disputed transactions, the Bank 
may, at its sole discretion, record the facts, evidences, telephonic conversations with the customer for the purpose of 
investigation. 
The Courts in Chennai, India, shall have exclusive jurisdiction to deal with all disputes between the Bank and the 
Cardmember, or the estate of the Cardmember and the Cardmember hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to 
submit him/her to such exclusive jurisdiction. SECURITY TIP

AIRLINE/RAILWAY 
REFUNDS 
On cancellation of an Airline/Railway ticket, if the credit is not processed to the Cardmember's Account within 30 days of 
the cancellation date, the Cardmember may immediately mail a copy of the credit voucher to enable the Bank to follow 
up with the concerned member Bank for processing the transaction. The Bank will credit the Card Account as appropriate 
on receipt of the proceeds from the processing Bank. However, any Charge/Finance charge(s) resulting from delay at any 
parties' end to process the credit will need to be borne by the Cardmember.  
The Ticket Deposit Receipt is not a valid credit note and the Bank would be unable to take up the matter with the concerned 
member Bank for processing the credit. Cardmembers must submit the Ticket Deposit Receipt to the concerned Railway 
Authorities within the specified time period (as applicable from time to time) and obtain a credit voucher. In the absence 
of a valid credit voucher, the Bank would be unable to credit the Card Account. 
The Cardmember hereby indemnifies the Bank fully against any liability (civil or criminal), loss, cost, expenses or damages 
that may arise due to non credit of the cancelled ticket amount by the concerned authorities/member Banks. 
FUEL ON CREDIT/RAILWAY SURCHARGE 
The Cardmember can use the HDFC Bank International Credit Card to buy fuel (petrol, diesel or other petroleum products 
or automobile related services or other merchandise at petrol pumps) on credit at select petrol pumps across the country 
or for certain online/Point of Sale transactions. Depending on the arrangement those organisations have with their 
member banks, the transaction will attract a service fee from the member bank and any taxes thereon, which may vary 
from time to time. This charge cannot be suppressed, and is due and payable. 
Currently all tickets booked with the Railways using the Credit Card would attract a handling charge from the member 
Bank at a fixed percentage/amount, which cannot be suppressed and is due and payable.            
Transactions done using the Card Account may in the future attract similar charges as specified by the 
Franchise/Authorities. Intimation as appropriate will be given by the Bank to the Card member from time to time. QUALITY 
OF GOODS AND SERVICES 
HDFC Bank shall not be in anyway responsible for merchandise, merchandise warranty or services purchased or availed of 
by the Cardmember from Merchant Partners including on account of delay in delivery, non-delivery, nonreceipt of goods 
or receipt of defective goods by the Cardmember. It must be distinctly understood that the Credit Card facility is purely a 
facility to the Cardmember to purchase goods or avail of services and HDFC Bank holds out no warranty or makes no 
representation about quality, delivery or otherwise howsoever, and any dispute or claim must be resolved by the 
Cardmember with the Merchant Partner. 
The existence of a claim or dispute shall not relieve the Cardmember of his obligation to pay all charges and the 
Cardmember agrees to pay promptly such charges, notwithstanding any dispute or claim whatsoever. 
Purchase made on the Credit Card shall remain the property of HDFC Bank till such time the charges pertaining thereto are 
paid in full by the Cardmember to HDFC Bank. HDFC Bank reserves the right at any time to seize or direct a Merchant 
Partner or any third party to seize all or any purchases made on the Credit Card if they are or come into possession, custody 
or control of HDFC Bank, the Merchant Partner or third party, as the case may be. 
All liquor charges shall be subject to the laws in each State for acceptance of the Credit Card. 
The Cardmember also specifically agrees that the services provided by the Affinity/Co-brand/Associated partners shall be 
with their exclusive expertise and that the Bank shall not be party to such service rendered by the Affinity/Co-
brand/Associated partners nor does the Bank provide any guarantee or responsibility or indemnity to the Cardmember as 
far as the services rendered such as its quality, accuracy, scope and cost to the Cardmember. The Cardmember hereby 
undertakes that any disputes or argument that he may have with the Affinity/Cobrand/Associated partners with respect 
to services rendered will not constitute valid reason for him/her to dispute, delay or default on dues owed - in full or in 
part - on his HDFC Bank International Credit Card.

Card 
Once a card is reported lost, it should not, under any circumstance be used if found by the Cardmember subsequently. As 
the Add-on Card is an extended facility given on the primary Card Account, the Add-on Card is rendered invalid when the 
Primary Card is reported lost. Similarly, if the Add-on Card is reported lost, the Primary Card Account and other Add-on 
Cards are invalidated. 
The Bank is not liable or responsible for any transactions incurred on the Card Account prior to time of reporting of the 
loss of the card and the Cardmember will be wholly liable for the same. After the receipt of proper notification of the loss 
by the Bank, the Cardmember's subsequent liability is zero. 
The Cardmember will be liable for all transactions on the card if the card(s) loss is not reported immediately and the FIR 
not filed within 3 days of the loss/theft of the card. 
Subject to the account being regular and the report of any card loss being received properly and in time, the Bank will 
reissue the Primary Card (and Add-ons, where applicable) on receipt of written instructions confirming the loss, along with 
the FIR and send the re-issued Cards to the address of the Primary Cardmember. However, the re-issue of the card is 
completely at the discretion of the Bank. 
The Cardmember will also fully co-operate with the Bank, the representatives of the Bank and/or legal authorities in the 
event of an investigation into any disputed transactions. 
The Cardmember hereby indemnifies the Bank fully against any liability (civil or criminal), loss, cost, expenses or damages 
that may arise due to loss or misuse of the card, in the event that it is lost and not reported to the Bank or lost and misused 
before the Bank is informed. 
CARD OR PIN LOSS OR THEFT 
The Cardmember (Primary and/or Add on) must make a written report to the Bank's Cards Division located at Chennai and 
its Regional Offices as intimated from time to time immediately once he/she becomes aware (or should reasonably have 
become aware in the case of lost or stolen Cards) that: The card or PIN record (or both) has or may have been lost or 
stolen; or  
The PIN has or may have become known to someone else; or, 
The card or PIN (or both) has or may have been used by someone else. 
If the Cardmember reports that the PIN may have become known to someone else or may have been used by someone 
else, the Cardmember must not continue to use that PIN. CREDIT CARD RE-ISSUE AND REPLACEMENT 
If the Cardmember's Credit Card becomes defective or gets damaged, the Cardmember may ask for a replacement card at 
any of the Bank's Cards Division located at Chennai and its Regional Offices as intimated from time to time. 
All such Credit Cards are subject to Terms and Conditions of Use and the Bank reserves the right not to reissue a Credit 
Card to any Cardmember. 
VALIDITY/EXPIRY/RENEWAL 
The Credit Card will be valid until the last day of the month printed on the face of the Credit Card. While some Cards 
could be issued for a validity period of one year, the Bank may, at its discretion, issue Cards with validity for a period 
exceeding one year. 
Unless in breach of the Terms and Conditions of Use, the Bank will automatically renew the validity of the card (and that 
of the Add-on Cardmembers) and send the new card(s) usually 30 days before the expiry of the current card(s). In case of  
non-receipt of the renewed card(s) before the stipulated time, Cardmember should contact the Bank's Credit Card Division 
located at Chennai and its regional offices as intimated from time to time. 
In case the Cardmember does not wish to renew his/her card(s), the Bank must receive his/her written instruction at least 
45 days prior to the expiry of his/her card(s). In the absence of this, the renewal fee (as applicable at the time of renewal) 
will be charged and must be paid and will not be refunded. 
The Cardmember must not attempt to use his/her card outside its validity period. The Bank will not be liable in any manner 
whatsoever, for any consequences that may arise due to the Cardmember's attempt to use the card outside its validity 
period.

CREDIT CARD CANCELLATION 
All Cards issued to the Cardmember remain the property of the Bank at all times and the Bank reserves the right to cancel 
and retrieve the card (and/or those issued to the Add-on Cardmembers) at any time without prior notice including if the

automatically cancel the card issued to the Cardmember as well as any Add-on Cardmembers. The Card Account would 
also be liable to be suspended on instructions from any government/regulatory body. All amounts outstanding on the Card 
Account shall be deemed to have immediately become due on death, insolvency, bankruptcy, winding up or instruction 
from government/regulatory bodies, as the case may be, and the Bank shall be entitled to recover the same in accordance 
with the relevant laws in force without prejudice to the obligation of the Cardmember to forthwith pay all outstanding 
amounts. 
In the event a Corporate Body is subject to any dissolution or winding up proceedings, or if any order is in force issued by 
a government/regulatory body which directly or indirectly prohibits the Bank from issuing Credit Cards to that Corporate 
Body, all Corporate Cards issued to employees of that Corporate Body would be cancelled without notice. The Bank is not 
liable for any claims arising out of such cancellation. All Cards would have to be destroyed and surrendered in the stipulated 
manner and all amounts outstanding on these Cards would become payable immediately. 
BY THE CARDMEMBER 
The Cardmember may cancel the Cards at any time by: 
Making a written request only to the Bank for cancellation of only Add-on Card or both Primary and Add-on Cards; and 
Cutting the card(s) diagonally in half and returning it to the Bank's Cards Division.

placed/ to be placed by the Cardmember (“FD Linked Card”), the Bank shall be authorized to mark a lien on the entire 
amount or such other amount as has been specified in this regard, of the said fixed deposit(s), whether such amount is 
additional to or by way of renewal of or replacement for any amount deposited/ to be deposited with the Bank or 
otherwise, together with, in each case, all and any interest from time to time accruing in respect thereof (all such fixed 
deposits with all such amounts and interest, collectively “FD”). The aforesaid lien over FD shall be the continuing security 
for the FD Linked Card issued/ to be issued by the Bank to the Cardmember. The Cardmember hereby irrevocably and 
unconditionally authorizes the Bank to renew, roll-over, re-book or book as new or multiple fixed deposits for such tenure 
as the Bank may deem fit, as also to liquidate the FD at the Bank’s sole discretion, any time, without requirement of any 
prior notice to or consent of the Cardmember and appropriate the proceeds towards outstanding dues of the FD Linked 
Card, along with all interest, fees, commissions, charges, expenses and all other costs (at the rates decided by the Bank, 
from time to time), whatsoever due or which may become due and payable under the FD Linked Card to the Bank. The 
Cardmember hereby undertakes that the Cardmember shall not take any actions for which he/she has authorized the Bank 
as above, unless specifically required by the Bank. The Cardmember hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Bank shall 
not be held responsible for the loss, charges or costs, if any, to the Cardmember arising due to such withdrawal/ liquidation

the right to increase or decrease the credit limit of the FD Linked Card at its sole discretion and the Cardmember agrees 
to plan any expenses accordingly and the Cardmember agrees to not hold the Bank responsible for any losses incurred

if any, and the Bank shall be entitled to proceed against the Cardmember including the recovery of any of its dues, at any 
time before or after the exercise of rights in relation to the lien. For avoidance of doubt, it is hereby clarified that even in 
the event of shortfall post withdrawal/ liquidation of the FD by the Bank (whether premature or otherwise) or in the event 
of any garnishee or seizure notice or attachment or similar action by any other person or authority in relation to the FD, 
the Bank shall be entitled to proceed against the Cardmember to recover the outstanding dues of the Bank (in case of 
withdrawal/ liquidation, if any, to the extent not recovered). This clause is a pre-requisite for issuance of FD Linked

option of the Bank, become immediately due and payable to the Bank. In case of any breach of the Terms and Conditions

The Bank accepts no liability whatsoever, direct or indirect, for non-compliance with the laws of any country other than 
the laws of India. The mere fact that the Credit Card can be accessed by a Cardmember in a country other than India shall

Cardmember Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of India. Subject to the following paragraph, the

the future as against the Cardmember, if any and/or any other persons, or any of their respective assets, under the 
Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 and/or the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, as

5. INTEREST RATES
ABOUT YOUR APRs
Your APRs are shown in Part 2.
A Daily Periodic Rate is used to determine your Interest Charges in any billing cycle. To determine this rate, we divide your 
APR by 365; then round this number up to the next hundred thousandth of a percentage point.
PROMOTIONAL OR INTRODUCTORY APR
We may offer you special Promotional or Introductory APRs from time to time. If we do, we will tell you:
•	The eligible transaction types;
•	how long this APR will last; and
•	any other special terms of the offer.
HOW A VARIABLE RATE MAY CHANGE
Your variable APRs can change with each monthly billing cycle.
We will apply each APR to the applicable balance for each type of Transaction. Each variable APR will be equal to:
INTERNAL
a) the amount shown in Part 2 (“Spread”); plus
b) the U.S. “Prime Rate” as defined below.
The Prime Rate will be as shown in the Money Rates table of The Wall Street Journal that is in effect on the last day of the 
month.
Any changes in the Prime Rate will take effect on the first day of your billing cycle beginning in the next month.
An increase in the U.S. Prime Rate will increase your Daily Periodic Rate (“DPR”). It may also increase your:
•	Interest Due; and/or
•	Minimum Payment Due.
ABOUT THE PENALTY APR

Mastercard®, HSBC Advance Mastercard®, HSBC Cash 
Rewards Mastercard®, HSBC Platinum Mastercard®, HSBC

made timely payments during the 6 months being reviewed.

6. INTEREST CHARGES
HOW INTEREST CHARGES ARE CALCULATED
To determine your periodic Interest Charges on each billing statement, we:
• Determine the Average Daily Balance for each type of transaction; (for example, purchases, balance transfers, and 
cash advances); then
• Multiply this number by the applicable DPR: then
• Multiply this number by the total number of days in the billing cycle.
We use the applicable DPR in effect on the billing statement closing date.
 
HOW DAILY BALANCE IS DETERMINED
To determine your Daily Balance, we:
• Take the beginning balance for each type of transaction that day; then
• Add the following that were incurred on that day:
a) Any new transactions;
b) Any previous day’s periodic Interest Charges;
c) Any Finance Charges; and
d) Any fees and charges, then
• Subtract any payments and/or credits.
We also make any needed adjustments. For example:
• If a transaction posts after, but occurs before the start of a billing cycle, we may adjust the amount above to include 
this transaction. It will be included as of the first day of the billing cycle in which it posts.
• If your Account is subject to a grace period during the billing cycle, your payments will be subtracted from all Daily 
Balances in the current billing cycle.
• If a transaction for a returned payment or a dispute resolved in our favor posts after the beginning of the billing cycle, 
we will make this adjustment:
The applicable Daily Balance(s) and any related Interest Charge calculations will be adjusted to include the transaction 
INTERNAL
amount as of the date of the original payment or transaction. 
To calculate your Average Daily Balance, we:
• Add the Daily Balances for each day of the billing cycle; then
• Divide this total by the number of days in the billing cycle.
 
PAYING INTEREST
Your due date is at least 25 days after the close of each billing cycle. Your Account has a grace period on purchases. We 
will not charge you interest on new purchases if you pay your previous non-promotional balance including fees and Interest 
Charges, by the due date each month. We will begin charging interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the 
transaction date, unless, under the terms of the promotional offer, no interest will accrue during the promotional offer 
period, provided your account remains in good standing. However, no Interest will be charged on new purchase for any 
billing cycle when:
• You paid your entire non-promotional balance plus any fees and finance charges in the previous month on time; and
• You pay your entire current month’s non-promotional balance plus any fees and finance charges on time as well.
7. PAYMENTS
PROMISE TO PAY
You promise to pay for all:
•	credit we extend; plus
•	Interest Charges and other fees or charges; plus
•	collection costs and attorney fees as allowed by law.
If your Account is a joint Account, each of you is jointly and individually responsible for amounts due. This remains true in 
the event of death, divorce or other events that affect liability between you and the other person.
If any joint Account holder requests to not be liable for future transactions, we may close the Account.
HOW WE APPLY PAYMENTS
•	When you make a payment, we apply the Minimum Payment Due to the balance on your monthly statement with the 
highest APR first.
•	Payment amounts in excess of your Minimum Payment Due will be applied to balances with higher APRs before 
balances with lower APRs.
•	We apply payments to balances appearing on your monthly billing statement before being applied to new 
transactions. An example of a new transaction is a recent purchase or cash advance that has not yet been included in 
the New Balance as shown on your statement.
If you do not pay your non-promotional balance in full each month, you may not be able to avoid interest charges on new 
purchases.
MINIMUM PAYMENT DUE
Your Minimum Payment Due each billing cycle will be as follows:
1. If your New Balance is $25 or less, your Minimum Payment Due is equal to your New Balance.
2. If your New Balance is more than $25, your Minimum Payment Due is equal to any amount past due, plus the greater 
of:
a) $25
b) 1% of your New Balance; plus
--Billed Late Payment Fees plus
--Billed Interest Charges
Unless your Minimum Payment Due is equal to your new Account balance, it will be rounded up to the nearest dollar.
INTERNAL
WHEN AND HOW TO PAY
You agree to:
•	Pay at least the Minimum Payment Due as shown on your billing statement, and described in this Agreement.
•	Make this payment in time to be credited by no later than the Payment Due Date.
If you wish, you may pay more than the Minimum Payment Due or the entire balance at any time.
Payments must be:
•	made in U.S. dollars; and
•	paid from a U.S. financial institution, and sent in a form that is acceptable to us.
Acceptable forms of payment include:
•	a check or money order; or
•	an electronic funds transfer.
If you want to write any special conditions on your payment, such as “paid in full”, “without recourse”, or similar language, 
you must mark this clearly on your payment. Send this payment to the address noted on your statement as the “Billing 
Inquiry” address.
Unless you follow the above directions, we may accept apayment marked with special conditions and not agree to those 
conditions, and will not lose any of our rights.
By sending us a check for payment on your Account, you authorize us either to:
•	use information from your check to initiate an electronic fund transfer from your payment account according to the 
terms of the check; or 
•	to process this transaction as a check.
When we use your check to make an electronic funds transfer:
•	funds may be withdrawn from your payment account the same day we receive your payment: and 
•	you will not receive your check back from your bank. 
When you use our optional payment by phone service, you agree that:
•	we may make an electronic funds transfer from the bank account you choose; or
•	we may process the payment the same way we would process a check. 
You authorize the amount and timing of each payment. Please retain this authorization for your records.
If your payment is returned:
•	the amount you paid will be reversed back to your Account and may be applied to a different category than originally 
posted; and
•	Interest Charges may be restored back to the payment date at the APR for that transaction.
8. FEES
TREATMENT OF FEES
Fees are listed on the Account Opening Table in Part 2 of the Cardmember Agreement.  
Any fees will be added to your purchase balance unless otherwise stated in this Agreement.
MINIMUM INTEREST CHARGE
If you are charged Interest, the charge will be no less than the Minimum Interest Charge listed in Part 2. The Minimum 
Interest Charge will be Allocated to each balance category subject to an Interest Charge.
BALANCE TRANSFER FEE
Applies to balance transfer and check transactions; and is assessed as of the date the balance transfer or check transaction 
posts to your Account. This fee is a finance charge. We will add it to the same balance as the balance transfer or check.
CHECK FEE
Applies to checks written for other purposes than Balance Transfers. We assess this fee as of the date the check posts to 
INTERNAL
your Account. This fee is added to the same balance as the check transaction, and is considered a Finance Charge.
CASH ADVANCE FEE
Applies to cash advance transactions; and is assessed as of the date the cash advance transaction posts to your Account. 
This fee is a Finance Charge. We will add it to the same balance as the cash advance.
OVERDRAFT TRANSACTION FEE
Overdraft transfers to your eligible HSBC deposit account from your credit card account will be a Cash Advance transaction 
under your Cardmember Agreement. Transfers will be subject to the terms of both your Cardmember Agreement and the 
Terms & Charges Disclosures governing your HSBC deposit account. In the event that your deposit account has insufficient 
funds, we will automatically transfer funds rounded to the next full dollar amount. Your HSBC Credit Card Account will 
cover any overdraft on your deposit account, as long as the credit available on your HSBC Credit Card Account is sufficient 
and you are not in default under your Cardmember Agreement.
The overdraft fee is computed based on the amount of each overdraft transaction. This fee is a Finance Charge. We will 
add it to the same balance as the overdraft.
ANNUAL FEE
If your Account has an annual fee, you agree this fee is charged to your Account every year your Account is open. We will 
post a reminder message on your billing statement a month prior to the Annual Fee being assessed.
How you can avoid paying an Annual Fee
•	Maintain relationship requirements as outlined in Part 2 of the Cardmember Agreement.
•	You may be able to product transfer your credit card to another HSBC Mastercard® credit card product. Product 
transfer may result in a change to your APRs and Fees and the loss of eligibility in the Rewards Program. Any 
accumulated Rewards Program Points will be transferred to your new HSBC Mastercard® credit card Account, if the 
HSBC Mastercard® credit card you choose has a Rewards Program.
•	Close your Premier World, Premier World Elite or Advance Mastercard® credit card Account. If your Account is closed 
you will not be able to use your Account for new transactions and you will forfeit all your Rewards Program Points as 
of the date the Account is closed.
•	Conditions for Annual Fee Reversals
•	If you have not used your Account and you close your Account within 90 days of when the Annual Fee was assessed, 
the Annual Fee will be refunded (if paid) or reversed. 
•	If the only balance on your Account is the Annual Fee and you do not pay the Annual Fee within 90 days from the 
Payment Due Date on which the said Annual Fee was payable,the Annual Fee will be credited and your Account will 
be closed.
•	If you close your Account before the Payment Due Date on the billing statement on which the Annual Fee is assessed, 
the Annual Fee will be refunded (if paid) or reversed. If your Account is closed, you must pay the balance according to 
the terms of this Agreement.
•	For Premier World and Advance Mastercard® Accounts if you are assessed an Annual Fee and have paid it in full and 
subsequently hold a qualifying U.S. HSBC Advance or Premier (which includes Jade) checking account relationship, 
the prorata portion of any paid Annual Fee will be refunded to you.
LATE PAYMENT FEE
For the HSBC Gold Mastercard, for each calendar year, the Late Payment Fee will be $0 for the first late payment, $28 for 
the second late payment, and $39 for each subsequent late payment within that calendar year. For all other cards, the Late 
Payment Fee is $28, except that the Late Payment Fee will increase to $39 for each subsequent late payment, and the Late 
Payment Fee will reset to $28 after you make 6 consecutive on-time payments. This fee will not exceed the amount of your 
Minimum Payment Due.
RETURNED PAYMENT FEE
It is charged each time a check or other form of payment to us is returned or not honored. The Returned Payment Fee will 
not exceed the amount of your Minimum Payment Due.
COPY REQUEST FEE
A fee may be charged each time a copy of a document is requested. The fee amount will be disclosed at the time of your 
request.
INTERNAL
FEES AND LIMITS
The fees that apply to your Account are shown in the purchase balance unless otherwise stated in this Agreement.
If charging any fee shown in Part 2 would exceed first-year fee limits set by law, we may charge an amount allowed by 
law. If we do this, it does not affect our ability to charge the full fee amount later. 
9. TRANSACTIONS MADEIN FOREIGN CURRENCIES
If you make a transaction in a foreign currency, the transaction will be converted by the Network, into a U.S. dollar amount 
in accordance with its operating regulations or conversion procedures in effect at the time the transaction is processed. The

date. The Network may change the procedures, from time to time, at its own discretion.

In your letter, give us the following information:

•	At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you 
think is wrong.
You must notify us of any potential errors in writing. You may call us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any 
potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question.
What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter
When we receive your letter, we must do two things:
•	Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have 
already corrected the error.
•	Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is 
correct.
While we investigate whether or not there has been an error:
•	We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount.
•	The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount.
•	While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance.
•	We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.
After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen:
•	If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that 
amount.
•	If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest 
and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you 
as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe.
If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still 
refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. 
INTERNAL
We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know 
when the matter has been settled between us.
If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question even if your billis 
correct.
Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases
If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in 
good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the 
purchase.
To use this right, all of the following must be true:
•	The purchase must have been made in your home State or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the 
purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on 
an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.)
•	You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a 
check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify.
•	You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase. 
If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing at:
HSBC Bank USA, N.A. PO Box 9, Buffalo, NY 14240

you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.

16. ARBITRATION
PLEASE READ THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION CAREFULLY. IF YOU DO NOT WANT DISPUTES TO BE RESOLVED 
THROUGH ARBITRATION, YOU MUST FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR REJECTING ARBITRATION NOTED BELOW.
IF ARBITRATION IS CHOSEN BY ANY PARTY, NEITHER YOU NOR WE WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO HAVE A CLAIM 
HEARD IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL ON THE CLAIM. IN ADDITION, YOU AND WE WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT 
INTERNAL
TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR MEMBER OF A CLASS. ARBITRATION PROCEDURES 
ARE GENERALLY SIMPLER THAN THE RULES THAT APPLY IN COURT, AND DISCOVERY IS MORE LIMITED. THE 
ARBITRATOR’S DECISIONS ARE AS ENFORCEABLE AS ANY COURT ORDER AND ARE SUBJECT TO VERY LIMITED 
REVIEW BY A COURT. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH BELOW, THE ARBITRATOR’S DECISION WILL BE FINAL AND BINDING. 
OTHER RIGHTS YOU OR WE WOULD HAVE IN COURT MAY ALSO NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.
IF YOU ARE COVERED BY THE PROTECTIONS OF THE MILITARY LENDING ACT, THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION DOES 
NOT APPLY TO YOU.
DEFINITIONS
In this Arbitration provision, “we”, “us” and “our” includes any corporate parents, successors, affiliates, assigns or 
related persons or entities. This Arbitration provision may also be enforced by any party named as a co-defendant with 
us in a Claim asserted by you. “Claim” means any past, current or future claim, dispute or controversy, whether known 
or unknown, arising from or relating to your Account, your application for an account, this Agreement or the relationship 
between you and us. If you have signed an Overdraft Protection Loan Agreement linking one or more checking accounts 
to your Account to provide overdraft protection, “Claim” also includes any past, current or future claim, dispute or 
controversy, whether known or unknown, arising from or relating to the Overdraft Protection Loan Agreement and related 
linked checking account transactions. “Claims” include any Claims related to advertising, debt collection or credit reporting 
and any Claim by or against any of our agents or any third parties. “Claims” include but are not limited to initial claims, 
cross-claims, counterclaims and third-party claims. “Claims” include but are not limited to Claims based in tort, contract, 
fraud, common law, equity, statutes and regulations of any kind.
CLAIMS SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION
Either you or we may require that any Claim be submitted to arbitration, except that: (1) only a court may decide any 
dispute about the validity, enforceability or scope of this Arbitration provision; however, any dispute or controversy that 
concerns the validity or enforceability of the Agreement as a whole is for the arbitrator to decide; and (2) Claim that you 
or we file in a small claims court or your state’s equivalent court is not subject to arbitration as long as the Claim is an 
individual Claim pending in that court.
You or we may demand to arbitrate any Claim at any time unless it has been filed in court and trial has begun or final 
judgment has been entered. Either you or we may delay enforcing or not exercise rights under this Arbitration provision, 
including the right to arbitrate a Claim, without waiving the right to exercise or enforce those rights.
LIMITATIONS ON ARBITRATION
CLAIMS MAY ONLY BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. CLAIMS MAY NOT BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS 
ACTION BASIS, ON A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL BASIS, ON A REPRESENTATIVE BASIS OR ON BEHALF OF THE 
GENERAL PUBLIC.
THE ARBITRATOR’S AUTHORITY IS LIMITED TO CLAIMS BY OR AGAINST YOU AND US ALONE. CLAIMS MAY NOT 
BE JOINED OR CONSOLIDATED UNLESS YOU AND WE AGREE IN WRITING. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT AWARD 
INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER RELIEF THAT IS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC.
(SEE THE ‘CONTINUATION’ SECTION BELOW FOR SPECIAL PROCEDURES THAT APPLY TO A CLAIM SEEKING PUBLIC 
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF).
HOW TO START AN ARBITRATION
To start an arbitration, contact the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) (1-800-778-7879, adr.org). AAA will administer 
the arbitration unless you and we agree in writing to use a different arbitration administrator or a different administrator is 
appointed by a court. 
ARBITRATION PROCEDURES
This Arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16 (the “FAA”). Virginia law shall apply 
to the extent state law is relevant under the FAA. The administrator’s rules that are in effect when a Claim is filed will apply 
unless those rules conflict with this Arbitration provision. The arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law, consistent 
with the FAA, statutes of limitations and privileges. The arbitrator will not apply any federal or state rules of civil procedure 
or evidence. Subject to the Limitations on Arbitration section above, the arbitrator may award any relief available in court 
on an individual claim consistent with the constitutional standards applicable in judicial proceedings. The arbitration will 
be confidential, but you may notify any government authority of your claim. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, you may 
choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely based on documents, through a telephonic hearing or by an in-
person hearing. At any party’s request, the arbitrator will offer a brief written explanation of the award. The arbitrator’s 
INTERNAL
award will be final and binding, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA; however, any party will have 30 days 
to appeal the award by notifying the arbitration administrator and all parties in writing. The administrator will appoint a 
three-arbitrator panel to decide anew, by majority vote based on written submissions, any aspect of the decision objected 
to. Judgment upon any award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction. No arbitration award involving the parties will 
have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute involving anyone who is not a party to the arbitration, nor 
will an arbitration award in prior disputes involving other parties have preclusive effect in an arbitration between the parties 
to the Arbitration provision. An arbitration award and any judgment confirming it cannot be used in any case or arbitration 
except to enforce the award. Arbitration hearings will take place by telephone or in the federal judicial district where you 
live.
ARBITRATION FEES AND COSTS
You will be responsible for paying your share of any arbitration fees (including filing, administrative, arbitrator hearing or 
other fees), but only up to the amount of the filing fees you would have incurred if you had brought a claim in court. We 
will be responsible for any additional Arbitration fees. At your written request, we will consider in good faith making a 
temporary advance of your share of any arbitration fees.
INSTRUCTIONS FOR REJECTING ARBITRATION
You may reject this Arbitration provision. To do so, you must send a written notice to us stating that you reject arbitration. 
Your rejection notice must be signed by you and include your name, address and Account number. Your letter notifying us 
that you reject this Arbitration provision must be postmarked within 60 days of the Account Opening Date. If you do not 
know your Account Opening Date, please call the number listed on the back of your card to obtain the date.
You must mail your rejection notice to HSBC Bank, N.A. P.O. Box 9, Buffalo, NY 14240. This is the only way that 
you can reject this Arbitration provision. If you reject this Arbitration provision, all other parts of the Agreement will 
continue to apply. Rejecting this Arbitration provision has no effect on any other agreements.
CONTINUATION
This Arbitration provision will survive termination of your Account, voluntary payment of your Account balance, any legal 
proceeding to collect a debt, any bankruptcy and any sale of your Account. If any portion of this Arbitration provision is 
deemed invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions of this Arbitration provision will still apply, except that:
(a) If a court determines that the “Limitations on Arbitration” section above is unenforceable with respect to a Claim that 
does not seek public injunctive relief and all appeals from that ruling have been exhausted, then this Arbitration provision 
(other than this sentence) will be null and void in its entirety; and
(b) If a court determines that the “Limitations on Arbitration” section above is unenforceable with respect to a Claim that 
seeks public injunctive relief and all appeals from that ruling have been exhausted, then the Claim seeking public injunctive 
relief will be determined in court and any individual claims seeking monetary relief will be arbitrated, in which case the 
parties will ask the court to stay the claim seeking public injunctive relief until the arbitration award pertaining to individual 
relief has been entered in court.

from any such Shareholder and the Board shall be at liberty to waive payment of such interest either wholly or in part.
g.	 Any sum, which by the terms of issue of a share or otherwise, becomes payable on allotment or at any fixed date or by 
instalments at a fixed time whether on account of the nominal value of the share or by way of premium shall for the purposes

for the recovery of any money claimed to be due to the Company in respect of his shares, it shall be sufficient to prove 
that the name of the Shareholder in respect of whose shares the money is sought to be recovered appears entered on the 
Register of Members as the holder, or one of the holders at or subsequent to the date at which the money sought to be 
recovered is alleged to have become due on the shares; that the resolution making the call is duly recorded in the minute

whom it is ought to be recovered, unless it shall be proved, on behalf of such Shareholder or his representatives against 
the Company that the name of such Shareholder was improperly inserted in the Register of Members or that the money

willing to advance the same, the whole or any part of the money due upon the shares held by him beyond the sums actually 
called up, and upon the amount so paid or satisfied in advance or so much thereof as from time to time and at any time 
thereafter as exceeds the amount of the calls then made upon and due in respect of the shares in respect of which such 
advance has been made, the Company may pay interest, as the Shareholder paying such sum in advance and the Board may 
agree upon; provided that the money paid in advance of calls shall not confer a right to participate in profits or dividend. 
Provided always that if at any time after the payment of any such money the rate of interest so agreed to be paid to any such 
Member appears to the Board to be excessive, it shall be lawful for the Board from time to time to repay to such Member 
so much of such money as shall then exceed the amount of the calls made upon such shares in the manner determined by 
the Board. Provided also that if at any time after the payment of any money so paid in advance, the Company shall go into 
liquidation, either voluntary or otherwise, before the full amount of the money so advanced shall have become due by the 
members to the Company, on instalments or calls, or in any other manner, the maker of such advance shall be entitled (as 
between himself and the other Members) to receive back from the Company the full balance of such moneys rightly due 
to him by the Company in priority to any payment to members on account of capital, in accordance with and subject to 
the provisions of the Act.

transferee communicates no objection to the transfer within 2 (two) weeks from the receipt of the notice.
16

the Company, send a notice of refusal to the transferee and transferor or to the person giving notice of such transmission, 
as the case may be, giving reasons for such refusal.

with any other Person or Persons indebted to the Company on any account whatsoever except where the Company 
has a lien on shares.

consider a proposal for transfer of shares comprised in a share certificate to several Shareholders, involving such splitting, 
if on the face of it such splitting/ transfer appears to be unreasonable or without a genuine need. The Company should not, 
therefore, refuse transfer of shares in violation of the listing requirements of the relevant Stock Exchanges on the ground 
that the number of shares to be transferred is less than any specified number.

recognize such Executors or Administrators or the legal representatives unless such Executors or Administrators or legal 
representatives shall have first obtained probate or letters of administration or succession certificate, as the case may be,

probate or letters of administration or succession certificate, upon such terms as to indemnity or otherwise as the Board

Board thinks sufficient, either be registered himself as the holder of the shares or elect to have some Person nominated by 
him and approved by the Board, registered as such holder; provided nevertheless, that if such Person shall elect to have 
his nominee registered, he shall testify the election by executing in favour of his nominee an instrument of transfer in 
accordance with the provisions herein contained and until he does so, he shall not be freed from any liability in respect of 
the shares.

such shares, in writing, to pay such Dividends to the transferee and will keep in abeyance any offer of right shares and/
or bonus shares in relation to such shares.
(III)	 In case of transfer and transmission of shares or other securities where the Company has not issued any certificates

Section 56 of the Act.

of any power of attorney, probate, letters of administration or other similar documents.

transfer of shares made or purporting to be made by any apparent legal owner thereof, (as shown or appearing in the

Your Privacy
1. Your Privacy. Your privacy is important to us. Please read the Microsoft Privacy Statement
(https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839) (the "Privacy Statement") as it describes the types of
data we collect from you and your devices ("Data"), how we use your Data, and the legal bases we have
to process your Data. The Privacy Statement also describes how Microsoft uses your content, which is
your communications with others; postings submitted by you to Microsoft via the Services; and the files,
photos, documents, audio, digital works, livestreams and videos that you upload, store, broadcast, create,
generate, or share through the Services or inputs that you submit in order to generate content ("Your
Content"). Where processing is based on consent and to the extent permitted by law, by agreeing to
these Terms, you consent to Microsoft’s collection, use and disclosure of Your Content and Data as
described in the Privacy Statement. In some cases, we will provide separate notice and request your
consent as referenced in the Privacy Statement.
Your Content
2. Your Content. Many of our Services allow you to create, store or share Your Content or receive
material from others. We don’t claim ownership of Your Content. Your Content remains yours and you
are responsible for it.
a. When you share Your Content with other people, you understand that they may be able to, on a
worldwide basis, use, save, record, reproduce, broadcast, transmit, share and display Your Content
for the purpose that you made Your Content available on the Services without compensating you. If
you do not want others to have that ability, do not use the Services to share Your Content. You
represent and warrant that for the duration of these Terms, you have (and will have) all the rights
necessary for Your Content that is uploaded, stored, or shared on or through the Services and that
the collection, use, and retention of Your Content will not violate any law or rights of others.
Microsoft cannot be held responsible for Your Content or the material others upload, store or share
using the Services.
b. To the extent necessary to provide the Services to you and others, to protect you and the Services,
and to improve Microsoft products and services, you grant to Microsoft a worldwide and royalty-
free intellectual property license to use Your Content, for example, to make copies of, retain,
transmit, reformat, display, and distribute via communication tools Your Content on the Services. If
you publish Your Content in areas of the Service where it is available broadly online without
restrictions, Your Content may appear in demonstrations or materials that promote the Service.
Some of the Services are supported by advertising. Controls for how Microsoft personalizes
advertising are available at https://choice.live.com (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?
LinkId=286759). We do not use what you say in email, chat, video calls or voice mail, or your
documents, photos or other personal files, to target advertising to you. Our advertising policies are
covered in detail in the Privacy Statement.
Code of Conduct
3. Code of Conduct. You are accountable for your conduct and content when using the Services.
a. By agreeing to these Terms, you’re agreeing that, when using the Services, you will follow these
rules:
i. Don’t do anything illegal, or try to generate or share content that is illegal.
ii. Don’t engage in any activity that exploits, harms, or threatens to harm children.
iii. Don’t send spam or engage in phishing, or try to generate or distribute malware. Spam is
unwanted or unsolicited bulk email, postings, contact requests, SMS (text messages), instant
messages, or similar electronic communications. Phishing is sending emails or other electronic
communications to fraudulently or unlawfully induce recipients to reveal personal or sensitive
information, such as passwords, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, passport numbers,
credit card information, financial information, or other sensitive information, or to gain access to
accounts or records, exfiltration of documents or other sensitive information, payment and/or
financial benefit. Malware includes any activity designed to cause technical harm, such as
delivering malicious executables, organizing denial of service attacks or managing command
and control servers.
iv. Don’t publicly display or use the Services to generate or share inappropriate content or
material (involving, for example, nudity, bestiality, pornography, offensive language, graphic
violence, self-harm, or criminal activity).
v. Don’t engage in activity that is fraudulent, false or misleading (e.g., asking for money under
false pretenses, impersonating someone else, creating fake accounts, automating inauthentic
activity, generating or sharing content that is intentionally deceptive, manipulating the Services
to increase play count, or affect rankings, ratings, or comments).
vi. Don’t circumvent any restrictions on access to, usage, or availability of the Services (e.g.,
attempting to “jailbreak” an AI system or impermissible scraping).
vii. Don’t engage in activity that is harmful to you, the Services, or others (e.g., transmitting
viruses, stalking, trying to generate or sharing content that harasses, bullies or threatens others,
posting terrorist or violent extremist content, communicating hate speech, or advocating
violence against others).
viii. Don’t violate or infringe upon the rights of others (e.g., unauthorized sharing of copyrighted
music or other copyrighted material, resale or other distribution of Bing maps, or taking
photographs or video/audio recordings of others without their consent for processing of an
individual’s biometric identifiers/information or any other purpose using any of the Services).
ix. Don’t engage in activity that violates the privacy of others.
x. Don’t help others break these rules.
More information about our policies, moderation and enforcement processes and service specific
terms is available at aka.ms/trustandsafety.
Using the Services & Support
4. Using the Services & Support.
a. Microsoft account. You’ll need a Microsoft account to access many of the Services. Your
Microsoft account lets you sign in to products, websites and services provided by Microsoft and
some Microsoft partners.
i. Creating an Account. You can create a Microsoft account by signing up online. You agree not
to use any false, inaccurate or misleading information when signing up for your Microsoft
account. In some cases, a third party, like your Internet service provider, may have assigned a
Microsoft account to you. If you received your Microsoft account from a third party, the third
party may have additional rights over your account, like the ability to access or delete your
Microsoft account. Please review any additional terms the third party provided you, as Microsoft
has no responsibility regarding these additional terms. If you create a Microsoft account on
behalf of an entity, such as your business or employer, you represent that you have the legal
authority to bind that entity to these Terms. You cannot transfer your Microsoft account
credentials to another user or entity. To protect your account, keep your account details and
password confidential. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Microsoft
account.
ii. Account Use. You must use your Microsoft account to keep it active. This means you must
sign in at least once in a two-year period to keep your Microsoft account, and associated
Services, active, unless a longer period is provided in the Microsoft account activity policy at
https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2086738 or in an offer for a paid portion of the
Services. If you don’t sign in during this time, we will assume your Microsoft account is inactive
and will close it for you. Please see section 4.a.iv.2 for the consequences of a closed Microsoft
account. You must sign into your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive (separately) at least
once in a one-year period, otherwise we will close your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive
for you. If we reasonably suspect that your Microsoft account is at risk of being used by a third
party fraudulently (for example, as a result of an account compromise), Microsoft may suspend
your account until you can reclaim ownership. Based on the nature of the compromise, we may
be required to disable access to some or all of Your Content. If you are having trouble accessing
your Microsoft account, please visit this website: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?
LinkId=238656.
iii. Kids and Accounts. By creating a Microsoft account or using the Services, you accept and
agree to be bound by these Terms and represent that you have either reached the age of
"majority" where you live or your parent or legal guardian agrees to be bound by these Terms
on your behalf. If you do not know whether you have reached the age of majority where you
live, or do not understand this section, please ask your parent or legal guardian for help. If you
are the parent or legal guardian of a minor, you and the minor accept and agree to be bound
by these Terms and are responsible for all use of the Microsoft account or Services, including
purchases, whether the minor’s account is now open or created later.
iv. Closing Your Account.
1. You can cancel specific Services or close your Microsoft account at any time and for any
reason. To close your Microsoft account, please visit
https://account.live.com/closeaccount.aspx. When you ask us to close your Microsoft
account, you can choose to put it in a suspended state for either 30 or 60 days just in case
you change your mind. After that 30- or 60-day period, your Microsoft account will be
closed. Please see section 4.a.iv.2 below for an explanation as to what happens when your
Microsoft account is closed. Logging back in during the suspension period will reactivate
your Microsoft account.
2. If your Microsoft account is closed (whether by you or us), a few things happen. First,
your right to use the Microsoft account to access the Services stops immediately. Second,
we’ll delete Data or Your Content associated with your Microsoft account or will otherwise
disassociate it from you and your Microsoft account (unless we are required by law to keep
it, return it, or transfer it to you or a third party identified by you). You should have a
regular backup plan as Microsoft won’t be able to retrieve Your Content or Data once your
account is closed. Third, you may lose access to products you’ve acquired.
b. Moderation and Enforcement. Many of our Services that allow you to interact, create, generate,
and share content with others leverage safety systems to protect our Services and other users.
i. Policies. Our Code of Conduct identifies what’s prohibited when using our Services. Our
content and conduct policies can be found here
(https://www.microsoft.com/DigitalSafety/policies). Specific Services have additional policies
and community standards applicable to their users, which are available here
(https://www.microsoft.com/DigitalSafety/policies/additional-guidelines).
ii. Reporting a Concern. You can report concerning content or conduct that may violate our
Code of Conduct here (https://aka.ms/reportconcerns).
iii. Review. Where applicable, we may use automated systems and humans to review content to
identify suspected spam, viruses, fraud, phishing, malware, jailbreaking, or other illegal or
harmful content or conduct.
iv. Enforcement. We reserve the right to deny content if it exceeds limits on storage or file size
allowed by the Service. We may block, remove or decline to display content if it appears to
violate our Code of Conduct or another Service policy or where required by law. If you violate
these terms or Policies (https://aka.ms/trustandsafety), we may take action against your
account. This could include limiting access to certain features or Services, stopping providing
Services, closing your Microsoft account immediately or blocking delivery of a communication
(like email, file sharing or instant message) to or from the Services. Closure of your access to a
Service or your account may result in forfeiture of content licenses, associated content,
memberships, and Microsoft account balances associated with the account. When reviewing
alleged violations of these Terms, Microsoft reserves the right to review content to resolve the
issue. However, we cannot monitor the entire Services and make no attempt to do so. For more
information about the moderation and enforcement processes
(https://www.microsoft.com/DigitalSafety/moderation-and-enforcement), Service specific terms,
Additional policies and guidelines (https://www.microsoft.com/DigitalSafety/policies/additional-
guidelines), and appeals (https://www.microsoft.com/DigitalSafety/moderation-and-
enforcement/appeals), see https://aka.ms/trustandsafety. Information about our policy relating
to claims of intellectual property infringement may be found at NOTICES.
c. Work or School Accounts. You can sign into certain Microsoft services with a work or school
email address. If you do, you agree that the owner of the domain associated with your email address
may be notified of the existence of your Microsoft account and its associated subscriptions, control
and administer your account, and access and process your Data, including the contents of your
communications and files, and that Microsoft may notify the owner of the domain if the account or
Data is compromised. You further agree that your use of the Microsoft services may be subject to
the agreements Microsoft has with you or your organization and these Terms may not apply. If you
already have a Microsoft account and you use a separate work or school email address to access
Services covered under these Terms, you may be prompted to update the email address associated
with your Microsoft account in order to continue accessing such Services.
d. Additional Equipment/Data Plans. To use many of the Services, you’ll need an internet
connection and/or data/cellular plan. You might also need additional equipment, like a headset,
camera or microphone. You are responsible for providing all connections, plans, and equipment
needed to use the Services and for paying the fees charged by the provider(s) of your connections,
plans, and equipment. Those fees are in addition to any fees you pay us for the Services and we will
not reimburse you for such fees. Check with your provider(s) to determine if there are any such fees
that may apply to you.
e. Service Notifications. When there’s something we need to tell you about a Service you use, we’ll
send you Service notifications. If you gave us your email address or phone number in connection
with your Microsoft account, then we may send Service notifications to you via email or via SMS
(text message), including to verify your identity before registering your mobile phone number and
verifying your purchases. We may also send you Service notifications by other means (for example
by in-product messages). Data or messaging rates may apply when receiving notifications via
SMS.
f. Support. Customer support for some Services is available at https://support.microsoft.com.
Certain Services may offer separate or additional customer support, subject to the terms available at
https://microsoft.com/support-service-agreement, unless otherwise specified. Support may not be
available for preview or beta versions of features or Services.
g. Ending your Services. If your Services are canceled (whether by you or us), first your right to
access the Services stops immediately and your license to the software related to the Services ends.
Second, we’ll delete Data or Your Content associated with your Service or will otherwise disassociate
it from you and your Microsoft account (unless we are required by law to keep it, return it, or
transfer it to you or a third party identified by you). As a result you may no longer be able to access
any of the Services (or Your Content that you’ve stored on those Services). You should have a regular
backup plan. Third, you may lose access to products you’ve acquired. If you have canceled your
Microsoft account and have no other account able to access the Services your Services may be
canceled immediately.
Using Third-Party Apps and Services
5. Using Third-Party Apps and Services. The Services may allow you to access or acquire products,
services, websites, links, content, material, games, skills, integrations, bots or applications from
independent third parties (companies or people who aren’t Microsoft) ("Third-Party Apps and
Services"). Many of our Services also help you find, make requests to, or interact with Third-Party Apps
and Services and may allow or require you to share Your Content or Data with such Third-Party Apps and
Services, and you understand that by using our Services you are directing them to make Third-Party
Apps and Services available to you. The Third-Party Apps and Services may allow or require you to store
Your Content or Data with the publisher, provider or operator of the Third-Party Apps and Services. The
Third-Party Apps and Services may present you with a privacy policy or require you to accept their terms
before you can install or use the Third-Party App or Service. See section 13.b for additional terms for
applications acquired through certain Stores owned or operated by Microsoft or its affiliates (including,
but not limited to, the Office Store, the Microsoft Store on Xbox and the Microsoft Store on Windows.
You should review the third-party terms and privacy policies before acquiring, using, requesting, or
linking your Microsoft Account to any Third-Party Apps and Services. Any third-party terms do not
modify these Terms. Microsoft does not license any intellectual property to you as part of any Third-Party
Apps and Services. You agree to assume all risk and liability arising from your use of these Third-Party
Apps and Services and that Microsoft is not responsible for any issues arising out of your use of them.
Microsoft is not responsible or liable to you or others for information or services provided by any Third-
Party Apps and Services.
Service Availability
6. Service Availability.
a. The Services, Third-Party Apps and Services, or material or products offered through the Services
may be unavailable from time to time, may be offered for a limited time, or may vary depending on
your region or device. If you change the location associated with your Microsoft account, you may
need to re-acquire the material or applications that were available to you and paid for in your
previous region.
b. We strive to keep the Services up and running; however, all online services suffer occasional
disruptions and outages, and Microsoft is not liable for any disruption or loss you may suffer as a
result. In the event of an outage, you may not be able to retrieve Your Content or Data that you’ve
stored. We recommend that you regularly backup Your Content and Data that you store on the
Services or store using Third-Party Apps and Services.
Updates to the Services or Software, and Changes to These Terms
7. Updates to the Services or Software, and Changes to These Terms.
a. We may change these Terms at any time, and we’ll tell you when we do. Using the Services after
the changes become effective means you agree to the new terms. If you don’t agree to the new
terms, you must stop using the Services, close your Microsoft account and, if you are a parent or
guardian, help your minor child close his or her Microsoft account.
b. Sometimes you’ll need software updates to keep using the Services. We may automatically check
your version of the software and download software updates or configuration changes. You may
also be required to update the software to continue using the Services. Such updates are subject to
these Terms unless other terms accompany the updates, in which case, those other terms apply.
Microsoft isn’t obligated to make any updates available and we don’t guarantee that we will support
the version of the system or device for which you purchased or licensed the software, apps, content
or other products.
c. Additionally, there may be times when we need to remove or change features or functionality of
the Service or stop providing a Service or access to Third-Party Apps and Services altogether. Except
to the extent required by applicable law, we have no obligation to provide a re-download or
replacement of any material, Digital Goods (defined in section 14.j), or applications previously
purchased. We may release the Services or their features in a preview or beta version, which may not
work correctly or in the same way the final version may work.
d. So that you can use material protected with digital rights management (DRM), like some music,
games, movies, books and more, DRM software may automatically contact an online rights server
and download and install DRM updates.
Software License
8. Software License. Unless accompanied by a separate Microsoft license agreement (for example, if you
are using a Microsoft application that is included with and a part of Windows, then the Microsoft
Software License Terms for the Windows Operating System govern such software), any software provided
by us to you as part of the Services is subject to these Terms. Applications acquired through certain
Stores owned or operated by Microsoft or its affiliates (including, but not limited to the Office Store,
Microsoft Store on Windows and Microsoft Store on Xbox) are subject to section 14.b.i below.
a. If you comply with these Terms, we grant you the right to install and use one copy of the software
per device on a worldwide basis for use by only one person at a time as part of your use of the
Services. For certain devices, such software may be pre-installed for your personal, non-commercial
use of the Services. The software or website that is part of the Services may include third-party code.
Any third-party scripts or code, linked to or referenced from the software or website, are licensed to
you by the third parties that own such code, not by Microsoft. Notices, if any, for the third-party
code are included for your information only.
b. The software is licensed, not sold, and Microsoft reserves all rights to the software not expressly
granted by Microsoft, whether by implication, estoppel, or otherwise. This license does not give you
any right to, and you may not:
i. circumvent or bypass any technological protection measures in or relating to the software or
Services;
ii. disassemble, decompile, decrypt, hack, emulate, exploit, or reverse engineer any software or
other aspect of the Services that is included in or accessible through the Services, except and
only to the extent that the applicable copyright law expressly permits doing so;
iii. separate components of the software or Services for use on different devices;
iv. publish, copy, rent, lease, sell, export, import, distribute, or lend the software or the Services,
unless Microsoft expressly authorizes you to do so;
v. transfer the software, any software licenses, or any rights to access or use the Services;
vi. use the Services in any unauthorized way that could interfere with anyone else’s use of them
or gain access to any service, data, account, or network;
vii. enable access to the Services or modify any Microsoft-authorized device (e.g., Xbox
consoles, Microsoft Surface, etc.) by unauthorized third-party applications.
Payment Terms
9. Payment Terms. If you purchase a Service, then these payment terms apply to your purchase and you
agree to them.
a. Charges. If there is a charge associated with a portion of the Services, you agree to pay that
charge. The price stated for the Services excludes all applicable taxes and currency exchange
settlements, unless stated otherwise. The price for Skype paid products includes a charge for the
product and a charge for taxes. You are solely responsible for paying such taxes or other charges.
Taxes are calculated based on your location at the time your Microsoft account was registered. We
may suspend or cancel the Services if we do not receive an on time, full payment from you.
Suspension or cancellation of the Services for non-payment could result in a loss of access to and
use of your account and its content. Connecting to the Internet via a corporate or other private
network that masks your location may cause charges to be different from those displayed for your
actual location.
b. Your Billing Account. To pay the charges for a Service, you will be asked to provide a payment
method at the time you sign up for that Service. You can access and change your billing information
and payment method on the Microsoft account management website
(https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618281) and for Skype by signing into your account
portal at https://skype.com/go/myaccount. Additionally, you agree to permit Microsoft to use any
updated account information regarding your selected payment method provided by your issuing
bank or the applicable payment network. You agree to promptly update your account and other
information, including your email address and payment method details, so we can complete your
transactions and contact you as needed in connection with your transactions. Changes made to your
billing account will not affect charges we submit to your billing account before we could reasonably
act on your changes to your billing account.
c. Billing. By providing Microsoft with a payment method, you (i) represent that you are authorized
to use the payment method you provided and that any payment information you provide is true and
accurate; (ii) authorize Microsoft to charge you for the Services or available content using your
payment method; and (iii) authorize Microsoft to charge you for any paid feature of the Services you
choose to sign up for or use while these Terms are in force. We may bill you (a) in advance; (b) at the
time of purchase; (c) shortly after purchase; or (d) on a recurring basis for subscription Services. Also,
we may charge you up to the amount you have approved, and we will notify you in advance of any
change in the amount to be charged for recurring subscription Services. We may bill you at the
same time for more than one of your prior billing periods for amounts that haven't previously been
processed.
d. Recurring Payments. When you purchase the Services on a subscription basis (e.g., monthly,
every 3 months or annually), you agree that you are authorizing recurring payments, and payments
will be made to Microsoft by the method and at the recurring intervals you have agreed to, until the
subscription for that Service is terminated by you or by Microsoft. You must cancel your Services
before the next billing date to stop being charged to continue your Services. We will provide you
with instructions on how you may cancel the Services. By authorizing recurring payments, you are
authorizing Microsoft to store your payment instrument and process such payments as either
electronic debits or fund transfers, or as electronic drafts from your designated account (for
Automated Clearing House or similar payments), or as charges to your designated account (for
credit card or similar payments) (collectively, "Electronic Payments"). Subscription fees are
generally charged in advance of the applicable subscription period. If any payment is returned
unpaid or if any credit card or similar transaction is rejected or denied, Microsoft or its service
providers reserve the right to collect any applicable return item, rejection or insufficient funds fee
and process any such payment as an Electronic Payment.
e. Online Statement and Errors. Microsoft will provide you with an online billing statement on the
Microsoft account management website (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618282), where
you can view and print your statement. For Skype, you can access your online statement by signing
into your account at www.skype.com (https://www.skype.com). This is the only billing statement that
we provide. If we make an error on your bill, you must tell us within 90 days after the error first
appears on your bill. We will then promptly investigate the charge. If you do not tell us within that
time, you release us from all liability and claims of loss resulting from the error and we won't be
required to correct the error or provide a refund. If Microsoft has identified a billing error, we will
correct that error within 90 days.
f. Refund Policy. Unless otherwise provided by law or by a particular Service offer, all purchases are
final and non-refundable. If you believe that Microsoft has charged you in error, you must contact us
within 90 days of such charge. No refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old. We
reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion. If we issue a refund or credit, we
are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future. This refund policy does not
affect any statutory rights that may apply. For more refund information, please visit our help topic
(https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618283).
g. Canceling the Services. You may cancel a Service at any time, with or without cause. Cancelling
paid Services stops future charges to continue the Service. To cancel a Service and request a refund,
if you are entitled to one, visit the Microsoft account management website. You can request a refund
from Skype using the Cancellation and Refund form (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?
linkid=618286). You should refer back to the offer describing the Services as (i) you may not receive
a refund at the time of cancellation; (ii) you may be obligated to pay cancellation charges; (iii) you
may be obligated to pay all charges made to your billing account for the Services before the date of
cancellation; and (iv) you may lose access to and use of your account when you cancel the Services.
We will process your Data as described above in section 4. If you cancel, your access to the Services
ends at the end of your current Service period or, if we bill your account on a periodic basis, at the
end of the period in which you canceled. If you initiate a chargeback or reversal with your bank for
your payment of Services, we will deem you to have canceled as of the date that the original
payment was made, and you authorize us to immediately cancel your service and/or revoke any
content that was provided to you in exchange for such payment.
h. Trial-Period Offers. If you are taking part in any trial-period offer, you may be required to cancel
the trial Service(s) within the timeframe communicated to you when you accepted the offer in order
to avoid being charged to continue the Service(s) at the end of the trial period.
i. Promotional Offers. From time to time, Microsoft may offer Services for a trial period during
which Microsoft will not charge you for the Services. Microsoft reserves the right to charge you for
such Services (at the normal rate) if Microsoft determines (in its reasonable discretion) that you are
breaching the terms and conditions of the offer.
j. Price Changes. We may change the price of the Services at any time and if you have a recurring
purchase, we will notify you by email, or other reasonable manner, at least 15 days before the price
change. If you do not agree to the price change, you must cancel and stop using the Services before
the price change takes effect. If there is a fixed term and price for your Service offer, that price will
remain in force for the fixed term.
k. Payments to You. If we owe you a payment, then you agree to timely and accurately provide us
with any information we need to get that payment to you. You are responsible for any taxes and
charges you may incur as a result of this payment to you. You must also comply with any other
conditions we place on your right to any payment. If you receive a payment in error, we may reverse
or require return of the payment. You agree to cooperate with us in our efforts to do this. We may
reduce the payment to you without notice to adjust for any previous overpayment.
l. Gift Cards. Redemption and use of gift cards (other than Skype gift cards) are governed by the
Microsoft Gift Card Terms and Conditions (https://support.microsoft.com/help/10562/microsoft-
account-gift-card-terms-and-conditions). Information on Skype gift cards is available on Skype’s
Help page (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=615383).
m. Bank Account Payment Method. You may register an eligible bank account with your Microsoft
account to use it as a payment method. Eligible bank accounts include accounts held at a financial
institution capable of receiving direct debit entries (e.g., a United States-based financial institution
that supports automated clearing house ("ACH") entries, a European financial institution that
supports Single Euro Payments Area ("SEPA") or "iDEAL" in the Netherlands). Terms you agreed to
when adding your bank account as a payment method in your Microsoft account (e.g., the
“mandate” in the case of SEPA) also apply. You represent and warrant that your registered bank
account is held in your name or you are authorized to register and use this bank account as a
payment method. By registering or selecting your bank account as your payment method, you
authorize Microsoft (or its agent) to initiate one or more debits for the total amount of your
purchase or subscription charge (in accordance with the terms of your subscription service) from
your bank account (and, if necessary, initiate one or more credits to your bank account to correct
errors, issue a refund or similar purpose), and you authorize the financial institution that holds your
bank account to deduct such debits or accept such credits. You understand that this authorization
will remain in full force and effect until you remove your bank account information from your
Microsoft account. Contact customer support as outlined above in section 4.e as soon as possible if
you believe you have been charged in error. Laws applicable in your country may also limit your
liability for any fraudulent, erroneous or unauthorized transactions from your bank account. By
registering or selecting a bank account as your payment method, you acknowledge that you have
read, understand and agree to these Terms.
Contracting Entity, Choice of Law, Jurisdiction
10. Contracting Entity. For use of free and paid consumer Skype-branded Services, you're contracting
with, and all references to “Microsoft” in these Terms mean, Skype Communications S.à.r.l, 23 – 29 Rives
de Clausen, L-2165 Luxembourg. For all other Services, you're contracting with Microsoft Corporation,
One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052, U.S.A.
11. Choice of Law and Place to Resolve Disputes. If you live in (or, if a business, your principal place of
business is in) the United States, the laws of the state where you live (or, if a business, where your
principal place of business is located) govern all claims, regardless of conflict of laws principles, except
that the Federal Arbitration Act governs all provisions relating to arbitration. You and we irrevocably
consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state or federal courts in King County, Washington,
for all disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services that are not heard in arbitration or
small claims court.
Warranties
12. Warranties. MICROSOFT, AND OUR AFFILIATES, RESELLERS, DISTRIBUTORS, AND VENDORS,
MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO
YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR OWN
RISK AND THAT WE PROVIDE THE SERVICES ON AN "AS IS" BASIS "WITH ALL FAULTS" AND "AS
AVAILABLE." YOU BEAR THE ENTIRE RISK OF USING THE SERVICES. MICROSOFT DOESN'T
GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY OR TIMELINESS OF THE SERVICES. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED
UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAW, WE EXCLUDE ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING FOR
MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
WORKMANLIKE EFFORT, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. YOU MAY HAVE CERTAIN RIGHTS UNDER
YOUR LOCAL LAW. NOTHING IN THESE TERMS IS INTENDED TO AFFECT THOSE RIGHTS, IF THEY
ARE APPLICABLE. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT COMPUTER AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS
ARE NOT FAULT-FREE AND OCCASIONAL PERIODS OF DOWNTIME OCCUR. WE DO NOT
GUARANTEE THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE OR THAT
CONTENT LOSS WON'T OCCUR, NOR DO WE GUARANTEE ANY CONNECTION TO OR
TRANSMISSION FROM THE COMPUTER NETWORKS.
Limitation of Liability
13. Limitation of Liability. If you have any basis for recovering damages (including breach of these
Terms), you agree that your exclusive remedy is to recover, from Microsoft or any affiliates,
resellers, distributors, Third-Party Apps and Services providers, and vendors, direct damages up to
an amount equal to your Services fee for the month during which the loss or breach occurred (or
up to $10.00 if the Services are free). You can't recover any other damages or losses, including
direct, consequential, lost profits, special, indirect, incidental, or punitive. These limitations and
exclusions apply even if this remedy doesn't fully compensate you for any losses or fails of its essential
purpose or if we knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. To the maximum
extent permitted by law, these limitations and exclusions apply to anything or any claims related to these
Terms, the Services, or the software related to the Services.
Service-Specific Terms
14. Service-Specific Terms. The terms before and after section 14 apply generally to all Services. This
section contains service-specific terms that are in addition to the general terms. These service-specific
terms govern if there are any conflicts with the general terms.
Xbox
a. Xbox.
i. Personal Noncommercial Use. The Xbox online service, Xbox Game Studios games (including
Mojang Games) (https://www.xbox.com/xbox-game-studios), applications, subscriptions (e.g.,
Xbox Game Pass subscription service offerings), services (e.g., Xbox Cloud Gaming), and content
provided by Microsoft (collectively, the "Xbox Services") are only for your personal and
noncommercial use.
ii. Xbox Services. When you sign up to receive Xbox Services, information about your game
play, activities and usage of games and Xbox Services will be tracked and shared with applicable
third-parties, including game developers and publishers, in order for Microsoft to deliver the
Xbox Services and for the third-parties to operate non-Microsoft games and services.
Additionally, if Xbox Services are accessed via third-party platforms, information about your
game play, activities and usage of games and Xbox Services may be tracked and shared by such
third-party platforms, subject to any third-party terms and privacy policies. If you choose to link
your Microsoft Xbox Services account with your account on a non-Microsoft service or sign in
to your Xbox Services account to access a non-Microsoft Service (for example, a non-Microsoft
game publisher of Third-Party Apps and Services), you agree that: (a) Microsoft may share
limited account and usage-related information (including without limitation gamertag,
gamerscore, game history, usage data and friends list), with that non-Microsoft party as stated
in the Microsoft Privacy Statement, and (b) if allowed by your Xbox privacy settings, the non-
Microsoft party may also have access to Your Content from in-game communications or other
applications that you use when you are signed into your account with that non-Microsoft party.
Also, if allowed by your Xbox privacy settings, Microsoft can publish your name, gamertag,
gamerpic, motto, avatar, gameclips and games that you’ve played in communications to people
you allow.
iii. Your Content. As part of building the Xbox Services community, you grant to Microsoft, its
affiliates and sublicensees a free and worldwide right to use, modify, reproduce, distribute,
broadcast, share and display Your Content or your name, gamertag, motto, or avatar that you
posted for any Xbox Services.
iv. Game Managers. Some games may use game managers, ambassadors, or hosts. Game
managers and hosts are not authorized Microsoft spokespersons. Their views do not necessarily
reflect those of Microsoft.
v. Kids on Xbox. If you are a minor using the Xbox Services, your parent or guardian may have
control over many aspects of your account on the Xbox platform and may receive reports about
your use of the Xbox Services. These features are exclusive to Xbox Services and may not
transfer to other platforms.
vi. Game Currency or Virtual Goods. The Xbox Services may include a virtual, game currency
(like gold, coins or points) that may be purchased from or on behalf of Microsoft using actual
monetary instruments if you have reached the age of “majority” where you live. The Xbox
Services may also include virtual, digital items or goods that may be purchased from or on
behalf of Microsoft using actual monetary instruments or using game currency. Game currency
and virtual goods may never be redeemed for actual monetary instruments, goods or other
items of monetary value from Microsoft or any other party. Other than a limited, personal,
revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to use the game currency and virtual
goods in the Xbox Services only, you have no right or title in or to any such game currency or
virtual goods appearing or originating in the Xbox Services, or any other attributes associated
with use of the Services or stored within the Xbox Services. Microsoft may at any time regulate,
control, modify and/or eliminate the game currency and/or virtual goods associated with any
one or more Xbox games or apps as it sees fit in its sole discretion.
vii. Software Updates. For any device that can connect to Xbox Services, we may automatically
check your version of Xbox console software or the Xbox app software and download Xbox
console or Xbox app software updates or configuration changes, including those that prevent
you from accessing the Xbox Services, using unauthorized Xbox games or Xbox apps, or using
unauthorized hardware peripheral devices with an Xbox console.
viii. Cheating and Tampering Software. For any device that can connect to Xbox Services, we
may automatically check your device for unauthorized hardware or software that enables
cheating or tampering in violation of the Code of Conduct or these Terms, and download Xbox
app software updates or configuration changes, including those that prevent you from
accessing the Xbox Services, or from using unauthorized hardware or software that enables
cheating or tampering.
ix. Additional Subscription Terms and Conditions. Xbox Services subscriptions are subject to
additional terms and conditions set forth in the Xbox Subscriptions Terms & Conditions | Xbox
(https://www.xbox.com/en-us/legal/subscription-terms).
x. Inactive Xbox Service Subscriptions. Microsoft may turn off your recurring billing and stop
recurring charges in select countries if you do not use your Xbox Services subscription for a
period of time. Microsoft will provide notice to you before turning off recurring billing. For more
information, including the applicable period of inactivity, see Subscription inactivity FAQ | Xbox
Support (https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/subscriptions-billing/manage-
subscriptions/xbox-subscription-inactivity-policy).
xi. Additional end-user license agreements and codes of conduct. Some Xbox Services may
have their own usage terms and codes of conduct.
Store
b. Store. "Store" refers to a Service that allows you to browse, download, purchase, and rate and
review applications (the term "application" includes games) and other digital content. These Terms
cover use of certain Stores owned or operated by Microsoft or its affiliates (including, but not limited
to, the Office Store, Microsoft Store on Xbox and Microsoft Store on Windows). "Office Store"
means a Store for Office products and apps for Office, Microsoft 365, SharePoint, Exchange, Access
and Project (2013 versions or later), or any other experience that is branded Office Store. "Microsoft
Store on Windows" means a Store, owned and operated by Microsoft or its affiliates, for Windows
devices such as phone, PC and tablet, or any other experience that is branded Microsoft Store and
accessible on Windows devices such as phone, PC, or tablet. "Microsoft Store on Xbox" means a
Store owned and operated by Microsoft or its affiliates and made available on Xbox consoles, or any
other experience that is branded Microsoft Store and made available on an Xbox console.
i. License Terms. We will identify the publisher of each application available in the relevant
Store. Unless different license terms are provided with the application, the Standard Application
License Terms ("SALT") at the end of these Terms are an agreement between you and the
application publisher setting forth the license terms that apply to an application you download
through any Store owned or operated by Microsoft or its affiliates (excluding the Office Store).
For clarity, these Terms cover the use of, and services provided by, Microsoft Services. Section 5
of these Terms also applies to any Third-Party Apps and Services acquired through a Store.
Applications downloaded through the Office Store are not governed by the SALT and have
separate license terms that apply.
ii. Updates. Microsoft will automatically check for and download updates to your applications,
even if you’re not signed into the relevant Store. You can change your Store or system settings if
you prefer not to receive automatic updates to Store applications. However, certain Office Store
applications that are entirely or partly hosted online may be updated at any time by the
application developer and may not require your permission to update.
iii. Ratings and Reviews. If you rate or review an application or other Digital Good in the Store,
you may receive email from Microsoft containing content from the publisher of the application
or Digital Good. Any such email comes from Microsoft; we do not share your email address with
publishers of applications or other Digital Goods you acquire through the Store.
iv. Safety Warning. To avoid possible injury, discomfort or eye strain, you should take periodic
breaks from use of games or other applications, especially if you feel any pain or fatigue
resulting from usage. If you experience discomfort, take a break. Discomfort might include
feelings of nausea, motion sickness, dizziness, disorientation, headache, fatigue, eye strain, or
dry eyes. Using applications can distract you and obstruct your surroundings. Avoid trip
hazards, stairs, low ceilings, fragile or valuable items that could be damaged. A very small
percentage of people may experience seizures when exposed to certain visual images like
flashing lights or patterns that may appear in applications. Even people with no history of
seizures may have an undiagnosed condition that can cause these seizures. Symptoms may
include lightheadedness, altered vision, twitching, jerking or shaking of limbs, disorientation,
confusion, loss of consciousness, or convulsions. Immediately stop using and consult a doctor if
you experience any of these symptoms, or consult a doctor before using the applications if
you’ve ever suffered symptoms linked to seizures. Parents should monitor their children’s use of
applications for signs of symptoms.
Microsoft Family Features
c. Microsoft Family Features. Parents and kids can use Microsoft family features, including
Microsoft Family Safety, to build trust based on a shared understanding of what behaviors, websites,
apps, games, physical locations, and spending is right in their family. Parents can create a family by
going to https://account.microsoft.com/family (or by following the instructions on their Windows
device or Xbox console) and inviting kids or other parents to join. There are many features available
to family members, so please carefully review the information provided when you agree to create or
join a family and when you purchase Digital Goods for family access. By creating or joining a family,
you agree to use the family in accordance with its purpose and won’t use it in an unauthorized way
to unlawfully gain access to another person’s information. Microsoft Family Features are exclusive to
Microsoft Services and are not transferable to other platforms. For example, Xbox-specific Family
Safety settings will apply on Xbox console or via Xbox on PC or Mobile device but may not apply on
other platforms.
Group Messaging
d. Group Messaging. Various Microsoft services allow you to send messages to others via voice or
SMS ("messages"), and/or allow Microsoft and Microsoft-controlled affiliates to send such messages
to you and one or more other users on your behalf. WHEN YOU INSTRUCT MICROSOFT AND
MICROSOFT-CONTROLLED AFFILIATES TO SEND SUCH MESSAGES TO YOU OR TO OTHERS, YOU
REPRESENT AND WARRANT TO US THAT YOU AND EACH PERSON YOU HAVE INSTRUCTED US TO
MESSAGE CONSENT TO RECEIVE SUCH MESSAGES AND ANY OTHER RELATED ADMINISTRATIVE
TEXT MESSAGES FROM MICROSOFT AND MICROSOFT-CONTROLLED AFFILIATES. "Administrative
text messages" are periodic transactional messages from a particular Microsoft service, including but
not limited to a "welcome message" or instructions on how to stop receiving messages. You or
group members no longer wishing to receive such messages can opt-out of receiving further
messages from Microsoft or Microsoft-controlled affiliates at any time by following the instructions
provided. If you no longer wish to receive such messages or participate in the group, you agree that
you will opt out through the instructions provided by the applicable program or service. If you have
reason to believe that a group member no longer wishes to receive such messages or participate in
the group, you agree to remove them from the group. You also represent and warrant to us that you
and each person you have instructed us to message understands that each group member is
responsible for the costs of any message charges assessed by his or her mobile carrier, including any
international message charges that may apply when messages are transmitted from US-based
numbers.
Skype, Microsoft Teams, and GroupMe
e. Skype, Microsoft Teams, and GroupMe.
i. Emergency Services. There are important differences between traditional mobile or fixed line
telephone services and Skype, Microsoft Teams, and GroupMe. Microsoft has limited obligations
under applicable local or national rules, regulations or law to offer access to emergency
services, such as 911 or 112 emergency calling (“Emergency Services”), through Skype,
Microsoft Teams, and GroupMe.
ii. Only limited software versions of the Skype to Phone feature of Skype may support calls to
Emergency Services in a very limited number of countries, and depending on the platform used.
You can find details about availability and how to configure this feature here:
https://www.skype.com/go/emergency. If your Skype to Phone emergency call is connected,
you will need to provide the details of your physical location to enable the emergency services
to respond to you.
iii. APIs or Broadcasting. If you want to use Skype in connection with any broadcast, you must
comply with the "Broadcast TOS" at https://www.skype.com/go/legal.broadcast. If you want to
use any application program interface ("API") exposed or made available by Skype you must
comply with the applicable licensing terms, which are available at www.skype.com/go/legal.
iv. Fair Use Policies. Fair usage policies may apply to your use of Skype. Please review these
policies which are designed to protect against fraud and abuse and may place limits on the
type, duration or volume of calls or messages that you are able to make. These policies are
incorporated in these Terms by reference. You can find these policies at:

ix. Skype Charges. Skype paid products are sold to you by Skype Communications S.à.r.l,
however the seller-of-record accountable for taxes is Skype Communications US Corporation.
Taxes means the amount of taxes, regulatory fees, surcharges or other fees that we are required
to collect from you and must pay to any United States (federal, state or local) or foreign
government, agency, commission or quasi-governmental body as a result of our provision of
Skype paid products to you. These taxes are listed at www.skype.com/go/ustax. All prices for
Skype paid products are inclusive of a charge for your product and a charge for taxes, unless
otherwise stated. The charges payable for calling phones outside of a subscription consist of a
connection fee (charged once per call) and a per-minute rate as set out at
www.skype.com/go/allrates. Call charges will be deducted from your Skype Credit balance.
Skype may change its calling rates at any time by posting such change at
www.skype.com/go/allrates. The new rate will apply to your next call after publication of the
new rates. Please check the latest rates before you make your call. Fractional call minutes and
fractional cent charges will be rounded up to the next whole unit. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, you may be entitled, under applicable law, to a refund, upon request, of any pre-paid
subscription balance in the event you switch your Skype Number to another provider.
x. Skype Credit. Skype does not guarantee that you will be able to use your Skype Credit
balance to purchase all Skype paid products. If you do not use your Skype Credit for a period of
180 days, Skype will place your Skype Credit on inactive status. You can reactivate the Skype
Credit by following the reactivation link at https://www.skype.com/go/store.reactivate.credit.
You can enable the Auto Recharge feature when you buy Skype Credit by ticking the
appropriate box. If enabled, your Skype Credit balance will be recharged with the same amount
and by your chosen payment method every time your Skype balance goes below the threshold
set by Skype from time to time. If you purchased a subscription with a payment method other
than credit card, PayPal or Moneybookers (Skrill), and you have enabled Auto-Recharge, your
Skype Credit balance will be recharged with the amount necessary to purchase your next
recurring subscription. You can disable Auto-Recharge at any time by accessing and changing
your settings in your account portal in Skype. If your Microsoft Account is closed, for any
reason, any unused Skype credit associated with your Microsoft account will be lost and cannot
be retrieved.
xi. International Message Fees. GroupMe currently uses US-based numbers for each group

text message. Please check with your provider for the associated international rates.

Microsoft Cashback
l. Microsoft Cashback. The Microsoft Cashback program (“Cashback”) allows Microsoft customers

(https://www.microsoft.com/bing/rebates-terms). Certain eligibility criteria, restrictions, and other
limitations apply to your participation in Cashback; for more information, see the Cashback FAQ
(https://www.bing.com/rebates/faq).
Microsoft Rewards
m. Microsoft Rewards.
i. General Information. Microsoft Rewards (the "Rewards Program") is free to join, and it
enables you to earn points ("Points") for certain activities and for personal use of certain
Microsoft products and services. If you have a Microsoft account and are located in a
participating Region (defined below), you have been automatically enrolled in the Rewards
Program and can begin earning Points immediately. You can cancel your participation in the
Rewards Program at any time by following the instructions below.
ii. You can redeem your Points in a variety of ways ("Redemption Options"), including for
certain products and services listed on the Redemption Page at https://aka.ms/redeemrewards
("Rewards"). To be eligible to redeem your Points for any Redemption Option, you must first
activate your Rewards Program account ("Rewards Account") on the Rewards Dashboard at
https://rewards.microsoft.com/ or on certain other Microsoft sites and pages. There is no cost to
activate your Rewards Account.
iii. Certain restrictions and limitations apply to earning, redeeming, and other uses of Points in
the Rewards Program. For more information see the Rewards section at
https://support.microsoft.com ("FAQ").
iv. Requirements. You need a valid Microsoft account and you must reside in one of the
geographic areas listed in the FAQ ("Regions") to activate your Rewards Account and to earn,
redeem, or otherwise use Points. You may open and use only one Rewards Account, even if you
have multiple email addresses. Each household is limited to six Rewards Accounts. The Rewards
Program is solely for your personal and noncommercial use. Use of a virtual private network
(VPN) or other technology or service that can be used to mask or obfuscate your geographic
location may result in cancellation of your Rewards Account and forfeiture of your accrued
Points.
v. Earning Points. You may be presented with opportunities to earn Points for certain qualifying
activities ("Offers"), such as Searches, Acquisitions, use of certain Microsoft products and
services, and other opportunities from Microsoft. You must have an active Rewards Account to
take advantage of such Offers. After completing requirements for certain Offers, you may be
required to claim the Points on the Rewards Dashboard before the Points are earned and added
to your Rewards Account. Failure to claim the Points within the time specified by Microsoft may
result in the Points being forfeited. Eligible Offers may vary by Region and may only be available
for a certain time or subject to other limitations. You must comply with all terms and conditions
of a particular Offer to earn Points awarded with that Offer. You may be presented with Offers
directly on the Rewards Dashboard or when you use certain Microsoft products and services.
From time to time, Microsoft may offer or award you additional Points in its sole discretion and
with or without prior notice, including for what Microsoft determines to be good-faith Searches
and other interactions with Microsoft services.
vi. For purposes of the Rewards Program, a "Search" is the act of an individual user manually
entering text for the good faith purpose of obtaining Bing search results for such user’s own
research purposes; a “Search” does not include queries not intended or used for genuine good-
faith personal research purposes or a query entered by a bot, macro, or other automated or
fraudulent means of any kind. For purposes of the Rewards Program, an “Acquisition” is the
process of purchasing goods or downloading and acquiring a license for digital content directly
from Microsoft, whether free or paid. Points are not offered for every Acquisition from
Microsoft, and certain restrictions may apply.
vii. Restrictions & Limitations on Points. Points are awarded by Microsoft to individual
Rewards Accounts and cannot be transferred to any other person or entity. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Microsoft may from time to time in its sole discretion permit you (i) to share your
Points within your household (limits may apply), (ii) to contribute your Points to support a
nonprofit organization listed on the Redemption Page, or (iii) depending on your Region and
subject to other terms and conditions, to redeem all or some of your Points for points in certain
other rewards or loyalty programs, including programs operated by Microsoft or authorized
third parties. Points are and remain at all times the property of Microsoft, and do not constitute
your personal property; they have no cash value, and you may not obtain any cash or money in
exchange for them. Points are awarded to you on a promotional basis only. You cannot
purchase Points. Microsoft may limit the quantity of Points or Rewards that can be earned or
redeemed per person, per household, or over a set period (e.g., a day) provided that you are
not disadvantaged in breach of good faith; please refer to the FAQ for currently applicable
limitations. Unless an Offer or Redemption Option explicitly states otherwise, Points earned in
the Program are not valid in, and may not be used in combination with, any other program
offered by Microsoft or third parties. Unredeemed Points associated with your Rewards
Account expire if you do not earn or redeem any Points in your Rewards Account for 18
consecutive months.
viii. Redemptions Redemption Options will be made available to you on the Redemption Page
and on certain other Microsoft sites and pages. You must earn and have available in your
Rewards Account all of the Points required for a Redemption Option before you can redeem
your Points for that Redemption Option. There may be a limited number of a particular Reward
available, and those Rewards will be delivered on a first-come, first-served basis. You may be
required to provide additional information, like your mailing address and a telephone number
(other than a VOIP or toll-free number), and you may also be asked to enter a fraud-prevention
code or sign additional legal documents to redeem Points for certain Redemption Options.
Once you redeem your Points, you cannot cancel or return the Redemption Option for a refund
of Points except in the case of defective products or as required by applicable law. If you select
a Redemption Option that is out of stock or unavailable for other reasons, we may substitute a
Redemption Option of comparable value or refund your points at our sole discretion.
ix. Microsoft may update or discontinue offering specific Redemption Options at any time for
any reason. Some Redemption Options may have age or Region eligibility requirements, or
other terms or conditions on their redemption or use. Any such requirements or conditions will
be included in the relevant redemption offer. You are responsible for all federal, state, and local
taxes and any other costs of accepting and using the Redemption Option. Rewards will be
emailed to the email address associated with your Microsoft account, so keep your email
address up to date. Rewards that are undeliverable will not be reissued and are therefore
forfeited. Rewards may not be resold. You may redeem no more than 550,000 Points per
calendar year in the Rewards Program.
x. Cancelling Your Rewards Account. If you no longer wish to participate in the Rewards
Program, follow the instructions on the opt out page
(https://account.microsoft.com/rewards/optout?confirm=false) to cancel your Rewards Account.
If you cancel your Rewards Account, you will immediately forfeit all of your earned Points and
will lose your ability to earn new Points in the future. To begin earning Points again, you must
open a new Rewards Account (but Microsoft will not reinstate any previously forfeited Points).
Your Rewards Account may be cancelled (and your Points forfeited) if you do not log in to
your Microsoft account for 18 consecutive months.
xi. Program Changes or Discontinuation. Microsoft reserves the right to change, modify,
discontinue, or cancel the Rewards Program or any part thereof at any time, in its sole
discretion, and without prior notice. However, if the Rewards Program is cancelled or
discontinued, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you by email and on the Rewards
Dashboard and to provide you with at least 90 days to redeem your accrued Points, unless we
determine that such cancellation must take effect immediately for legal or security reasons.
xii. Other Terms. Microsoft reserves the right to immediately cancel your Rewards Account,
disqualify you from future participation in the Rewards Program, forfeit all of your earned
Points, and cancel or suspend any Redemption Option you have obtained through the Rewards
Program if Microsoft believes you have tampered with, abused, or defrauded any aspect of the
Rewards Program or breached these terms. Microsoft further reserves the right to cancel or
suspend any Redemption Option you have obtained or attempted to obtain through the
Rewards Program if Microsoft determines you are ineligible to receive that Redemption Option
for legal reasons (such as export laws). While Microsoft makes every effort to ensure accuracy,
errors occasionally occur. Microsoft therefore reserves the right to correct such errors at any
time, even if it affects current Offers or your pending, earned, or redeemed Points or Rewards.
In the event of any inconsistency or discrepancy between these Rewards Program terms or
other statements contained in any related materials or advertising, these terms prevail, govern,
and control.

vi. Ownership of Content. Microsoft doesn't claim ownership of any content you provide, post,

Microsoft stores information about its creation and associates this information and the content
with a content credential. You may not create content with the purpose of removing or altering

was generated by the AI services or otherwise use the AI services to create content for the
purpose of misleading others about whether an output was generated by the AI services.

regarding Your use of the AI services in compliance with applicable laws (including, but not
limited to, copyright infringement or other claims relating to content output during Your use of

Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver
15. Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver If You Live In (or, If a Business, Your Principal Place
of Business Is In) the United States. We hope we never have a dispute, but if we do, you and we agree
to try for 60 days, upon receipt of a Notice of Dispute, to resolve it informally. If we can’t, you and we
agree to binding individual arbitration before the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under
the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"), and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury. Instead, a
neutral arbitrator will decide and the arbitrator’s decision will be final except for a limited right of review
under the FAA. Class action lawsuits, class-wide arbitrations, private attorney-general actions,
requests for public injunctions, and any other proceeding or request for relief where someone acts
in a representative capacity aren’t allowed. Nor is combining individual proceedings without the
consent of all parties. "We," "our," and "us" includes Microsoft and Microsoft’s affiliates.
a. Disputes Covered—Everything Except IP. The term "dispute" is as broad as it can be. It includes
any claim or controversy between you and us concerning the Services, the software related to the
Services, the Services’ or software’s price, your Microsoft account, marketing, communications, your
purchase transaction, billing, or these Terms, under any legal theory including contract, warranty,
tort, statute, or regulation, except disputes relating to the enforcement or validity of your, your
licensors’, our, or our licensors’ intellectual property rights.
b. Send a Notice of Dispute Before Arbitration. If you have a dispute that our customer service
representatives can’t resolve and you wish to pursue arbitration, you must first send an
individualized Notice of Dispute to Microsoft Corporation, ATTN: CELA Arbitration, One
Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, U.S.A., or submit the form electronically. The
Notice of Dispute form is available at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245499. Complete
that form in full, with all the information it requires. We’ll do the same if we have a dispute with you.
This Notice of Dispute is a prerequisite to initiating any arbitration. Any applicable statute of
limitations will be tolled from the date of a properly submitted individualized Notice of Dispute
through the first date on which an arbitration may properly be filed under this section 15.
c. Small Claims Court Option. Instead of sending a Notice of Dispute, either you or we may sue the
other party in small claims court seeking only individualized relief, so long as the action meets the
small claims court’s requirements and remains an individual action seeking individualized relief. The
small claims court must be in your county of residence (or, if a business, your principal place of
business).
d. Arbitration Procedure. The AAA will conduct any arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration
Rules (or if you are an individual and use the Services for personal or household use, or if the value
of the dispute is less than $75,000 whether or not you are an individual or how you use the Services,
its Consumer Arbitration Rules). The AAA’s Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules, as modified by
this section 15, will apply in Related Cases (discussed below). For more information, see
www.adr.org. Section 15 and these Terms govern to the extent they conflict with any
applicable AAA rules. To initiate an arbitration, submit the Demand for Arbitration form available at
https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245497 to the AAA and mail a copy to us. The form must
contain information that is specific to you and your claim. In a dispute involving $25,000 or less, any
hearing will be telephonic or by videoconference unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an
in-person hearing instead. Any in-person hearing will take place in your county of residence (or, if a
business, your principal place of business). The arbitrator may award the same damages to you
individually as a court could. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only to
you individually to satisfy your individual claim, but not relief that would affect non-parties.
The arbitrator rules on all issues except that a court has exclusive authority: (i) to decide arbitrability,
as well as formation, existence, scope, validity, and enforceability of this arbitration agreement; (ii) to
decide whether the parties have complied with the pre-arbitration requirements (including the
individualized Notice of Dispute and Demand for Arbitration forms); (iii) to enforce the prohibition
on class, representative, private attorney-general, or combined actions or proceedings, or public
injunctive relief; and (iv) to enjoin an arbitration from proceeding if it does not comply with this
section 15.
If your Notice of Dispute involves claims similar to those of at least 24 other customers, and if you
and those other customers are represented by the same lawyers, or by lawyers who are coordinating
with each other, you and we agree that these claims will be “Related Cases.” You and we agree that
the AAA’s Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules in effect when the Demand for Arbitration is filed,
as modified by this section 15, will apply to Related Cases. Related Cases may only be filed in
batches of up to 50 individual arbitrations at a time, and those individual arbitrations will be
resolved in the following manner: (i) for the first batch, each side may select up to 25 of these
Related Cases to be filed and resolved in individual arbitrations under this section 15; (ii) none of the
other Related Cases may be filed or prosecuted in arbitration until the first batch of up to 50
individual arbitrations is resolved; and (iii) if, after that first batch, the parties are unable to resolve
the remaining Related Cases, a second batch of Related Cases may be filed, where each side may
select up to 25 of the Related Cases to be resolved in individual arbitrations under this section 15.
This process of batched individual arbitrations will continue until the parties resolve all Related Cases
informally or through individual arbitrations. A court has exclusive authority to enforce this
paragraph, including whether it applies to a given set of claims, and to enjoin the filing or
prosecution of arbitrations that do not comply with this paragraph.
e. Arbitration Fees and Payments. The AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAA’s
arbitrator’s fees and expenses.
In addition, if the dispute is not part of the Related Cases described above, the dispute involves
less than $75,000, and before initiating arbitration you complied with all pre-arbitration
requirements in this section 15, then (1) we will promptly reimburse your filing fees and pay the
AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses; and (2) if, at the conclusion of the arbitration, the
arbitrator awards you more than our last written offer made before the arbitrator was
appointed, we will: pay you (i) the amount of the award or $1,000 (whichever is more); and; (ii)
for any reasonable attorney’s fees you incurred; and any reasonable expenses (including expert
witness fees and costs) that your attorney accrued in connection with your individual
arbitration.
f. Rejecting Future Arbitration Changes. You may reject any change we make to section 15 (except
address changes) by personally signing and sending us notice within 30 days of the change by U.S.
Mail to the address in section 15.b. If you do, the most recent version of section 15 before the
change you rejected will apply.
g. Severability. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, a court finds any part of this section 15
unenforceable as to any claim or request for a remedy, then the parties agree to arbitrate all claims
and remedies subject to arbitration before litigating in court any remaining claims or remedies (such
as a request for a public injunction remedy, in which case the arbitrator issues an award on liability
and individual relief before a court considers that request). Otherwise, if any other part of section 15
is found to be unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect (with an arbitration award issued
before any court proceeding begins).
Miscellaneous
16. Miscellaneous. This section, and sections 1, 9 (for amounts incurred before the end of these Terms),
10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 18 and those that by their terms apply after the Terms end will survive any termination
or cancellation of these Terms. We may assign these Terms, in whole or in part, at any time without notice
to you. You may not assign your rights or obligations under these Terms or transfer any rights to use the
Services. This is the entire agreement between you and Microsoft for your use of the Services. It
supersedes any prior agreements between you and Microsoft regarding your use of the Services. All
parts of these Terms apply to the maximum extent permitted by relevant law. If a court or arbitrator
holds that we can't enforce a part of these Terms as written, we may replace those terms with similar
terms to the extent enforceable under the relevant law, but the rest of these Terms won't change. Section
15.g says what happens if parts of section 15 (arbitration and class action waiver) are found to be
unenforceable. Section 15.g prevails over this section if inconsistent with it. Except for section 15
(arbitration and class action waiver) these Terms are solely for your and our benefit; they aren’t for the
benefit of any other person, except for Microsoft’s successors and assigns.
17. Export Laws. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that
apply to the software and/or Services, which include restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use.
For further information on geographic and export restrictions, visit https://www.microsoft.com/exporting.
18. Reservation of Rights and Feedback. Except as expressly provided under these Terms, Microsoft
does not grant you a license or any other rights of any type under any patents, know-how, copyrights,
trade secrets, trademarks or other intellectual property owned or controlled by Microsoft or any related
entity, including but not limited to any name, trade dress, logo or equivalents. If you give to Microsoft
any idea, proposal, suggestion or feedback, including without limitation ideas for new products,
technologies, promotions, product names, product feedback and product improvements ("Feedback"),
you give to Microsoft, without charge, royalties or other obligation to you, the right to make, have made,
create derivative works, use, share and commercialize your Feedback in any way and for any purpose.
You will not give Feedback that is subject to a license that requires Microsoft to license its software,
technologies or documentation to any third party because Microsoft includes your Feedback in them.
